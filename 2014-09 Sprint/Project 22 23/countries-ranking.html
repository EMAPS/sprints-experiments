    <p>This visualisation ranks the countries that requested funds through the NAPAs, received funds from the MLFs and the bilateral funds. So, those that requested the largest amount in the NAPAs are at the top of the ranking. Those that requested the least amount are at the bottom of the list. Those which are at the top of the Multilateral Projects and Bilateral Projects lists received the largest amounts of money. Those at the bottom received the least.  This aims to address the question: did those asking for the most money received the most? Did those asking the least receive the least?</p>

    <p>It is important to remember that the Multilateral funds and Bilateral funds support countries that aren't LDCs so there are more countries listed in the Multilateral and Bilateral project lists.</p>
