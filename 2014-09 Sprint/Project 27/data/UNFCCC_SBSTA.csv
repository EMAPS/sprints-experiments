OPENING OF THE SESSION 1. The first session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (hereinafter referred to as  the SBSTA ) was held at Geneva from 28 August to 1 September 1995. The session was convened in accordance with decision 6/CP.1 |  paragraph 8 (FCCC/CP/1997/Add.1). However |  the schedule of meetings for the SBSTA as given in annex III to that decision was changed following a meeting of the Bureau of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in Bonn on 19 June 1995. Accordingly |  the session scheduled for October 1995 was brought forward to August 1995. 2. The Chairman of the SBSTA |  Mr. Tibor Faragó |  opened the session at the 1st meeting |  on 28 August 1995. In welcoming the participants |  he recalled that the SBSTA had been established under Article 9 of the Convention to provide timely information and advice on scientific and technological matters relating to the Convention. The basic functions of the SBSTA as outlined in Article 9 had been further elaborated in many of the decisions of the COP at its first session and particularly in decision 6/CP.1 on the roles of the subsidiary bodies. More recently |  requests for advice had been received from the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM). There was therefore considerable work to be done. As Chairman |  he undertook to fulfil his responsibilities as efficiently and effectively as possible and he called upon all participants to assist him in an active and constructive manner. 3. The Executive Secretary welcomed all participants to the session. He drew attention to the organizational nature of the session and to the distinctions between the responsibilities of the SBSTA and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) which had guided the secretariat in drawing up the proposed programmes of work of both bodies. He referred to several important matters on which decisions were expected from the session |  including the establishment of the intergovernmental technical advisory panels |  future cooperation with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the organization of a workshop on non-governmental inputs. He also emphasized the need to establish a clear schedule and |  in particular |  to define inputs required for the next session of the SBSTA in February 1996. |  |  |  | II. ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS (Agenda item 1) A. Adoption of the agenda 4. At its 1st plenary meeting |  on 28 August |  the SBSTA adopted the following agenda: 1.

Having discussed a text proposed by the Chairman (FCCC/SBSTA/1995/L.2) |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusion: (a) The SBSTA noted that the IPCC would adopt the Second Assessment Report at its December session. It was recognized that this would include important information for the Convention |  and would require priority attention at the second session to enable the SBSTA to provide relevant advice to the AGBM as requested (FCCC/AGBM/1995/2 |  para. 19 (f)). The secretariat was requested to prepare a document for consideration by the SBSTA |  identifying issues and suggesting what future inputs might be needed |  including those relevant to the AGBM process. |  |  |  | B. |  |  |  | Cooperation with competent international bodies including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 1. Proceedings |  |  |  | 22. This sub-item was considered at the 2nd |  3rd and 7th plenary meetings on 28 and 29 August and 1 September. 23. At the 2nd plenary meeting on 28 August |  the representative of the IPCC responded to some questions arising from the statement of the Chairman of the IPCC. |  |  |  | 2. Conclusions 24. Having discussed a text proposed by the Chairman (FCCC/SBSTA/1995/L.1) |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA expressed strong support for the continued functioning of the IPCC as one of the independent and prominent sources of scientific and technical information relevant to the implementation of the Convention |  as specified in Article 9; (b) The SBSTA would also cooperate with competent international bodies and programmes in areas related to scientific |  methodological |  technical |  socio-economic and technological questions in accordance with decisions 4 |  5 |  6 and 13 adopted at COP 1 (FCCC/CP/1995/7/Add.1); (c) The SBSTA identified a list of areas in which it could draw upon the assistance of the IPCC in order to provide the COP with timely information and advice on relevant scientific and technical issues. This list of areas |  which is preliminary and necessarily of a general nature |  is presented in the annex to this report. The list is subject to changes |  |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1995/3 English Page 11 |  |  |  | modifications |  refinements and additions. There will also be a need to identify short- and long-term requirements. The SBSTA requested its Bureau to hold joint meetings with the Officers of the IPCC and report to each of its sessions on the outcome of these meetings; (d) The SBSTA also envisaged the need for scientific and technical advice from the IPCC on special emerging topics to be made available within short periods of time (perhaps one year or so); (e) The SBSTA agreed that there would be a need for close coordination between the SBSTA and the IPCC in identifying more specific proposals for jointly agreed tasks and considering such matters as time-frames for implementation and financial implications |  including contributions to the IPCC from the Convention budget. It felt that this would be particularly important after the consideration by the SBSTA of the IPCC Second Assessment Report; (f) After consideration by the SBSTA of the IPCC Second Assessment Report |  the secretariat should prepare a list of priority areas and propose time-frames in which inputs from the IPCC would be required for the future work of the SBSTA; (g) This sub-item would be kept under regular review by the SBSTA. |  |  |  | C. Transfer of technology 1. Proceedings 25. This sub-item was considered at the 4th and 7th plenary meetings on 29 August and 1 September. |  |  |  | 2. Conclusions 26.

Conclusions 100. The SBSTA took note of document FCCC/SBSTA/2004/MISC.14 containing views from Parties on issues from the research event at the twentieth session of the SBSTA. The SBSTA agreed to consider in depth at its twenty-second session (May 2005) the issues relating to the research needs of the Convention. 101. The SBSTA welcomed document FCCC/SBSTA/2004/MISC.16 containing the executive summary of the Implementation Plan for the Global Observing System for Climate in Support of the UNFCCC (hereinafter referred to as the implementation plan) prepared by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) secretariat under the guidance of the GCOS steering committee.29 According to this plan |  priority for climate should be given to the following actions: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Improving in situ and key satellite observation networks Generating integrated global climate products for atmospheric |  oceanic and terrestrial domains Enhancing the participation of the least developed countries and small island developing States Improving access by all Parties to global climate data for essential climate variables and climate products Strengthening national |  regional and international infrastructure relating to global observing systems for climate. |  |  |  | 102. The SBSTA stressed that effective implementation of this plan |  including the full consideration of the needs of developing countries to enhance their capacity to effectively use observation data and climate products |  can provide relevant information on climate variability and climate change that would contribute to developing adaptation and mitigation responses. It emphasized that coordinated and concentrated efforts by governments and relevant international organizations are required to fully implement this plan. 103. The SBSTA invited the GCOS secretariat |  in conjunction with the GCOS sponsoring agencies | 30 to report to the SBSTA at its twenty-third session (November 2005) and |  as required |  at subsequent sessions |  on how the actions identified in the implementation plan have been incorporated in the agencies’ own plans and actions. It also invited the GCOS secretariat to prepare a synthesis report on this matter by the twenty-fourth session of the SBSTA (May 2006). 104. The SBSTA encouraged Parties to incorporate actions supporting the implementation of the implementation plan in their national plans and actions relating to global climate observing systems. 105. The SBSTA invited all Parties to report on their activities as specified in paragraph 104 above |  including those in relation to the priorities referred to in paragraph 101 above |  in their detailed reports on systematic observation |  in accordance with the guidelines contained in document FCCC/CP/1999/7 |  and |  |  |  | 29 30 |  |  |  | __________________________ |  | Available as report no.

Statements were made by representatives of 12 Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China |  one on behalf of the European Community and its member States |  and one on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). 9. At its 1st meeting |  the SBSTA agreed to consider both sub-items in a contact group chaired by the SBSTA Chair. At the 6th meeting |  the SBSTA Chair reported on the contact group’s consultations. 10. At the 6th meeting |  the representative of the Russian Federation noted that scientific and practical substantiation of political decisions should be at the very core of any consultative process |  especially a multilateral one such as climate negotiations. The representative noted that the Third Assessment Report (TAR) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) contains crucial information and data that not only substantiate the ultimate objective of the Convention |  but also provide a scientific basis for achieving it. The TAR is global in nature and applicable to all Parties to the Convention. The two new items on the SBSTA agenda are an important |  but still insufficient |  step in understanding the process and effects of climate change. The representative expressed regret that these concepts were not summarized in the conclusions and decision on this matter and requested that his statement be summarized in the report of the session. 2.

The SBSTA requested the secretariat to continue its efforts to improve access to GHG data and other relevant information on the secretariat web site and through other means; (d) The SBSTA noted the need to improve access by Parties to existing data and analytical tools |  with a view to |  inter alia |  assisting Parties to build their capacity for analysis and decision-making and to implement their commitments under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. The SBSTA recognized that the development of a data interface could be an important approach to meeting these needs; (e) The SBSTA requested the secretariat |  subject to the availability of resources |  to initiate a scoping phase for consideration of a data interface and to facilitate this by providing links on its web site to the sources of data referenced in document FCCC/SBSTA/2003/INF.9. The SBSTA invited Parties to submit to the secretariat |  by 30 July 2004 |  their views on a possible data interface and other issues raised in document FCCC/SBSTA/2003/INF.9. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to provide a synthesis of the views of Parties on the options for development of a data interface contained in document FCCC/SBSTA/2003/INF.9. The SBSTA decided to continue consideration of this matter at its twenty-first session; (f) The SBSTA requested the secretariat |  subject to the availability of resources |  to organize a workshop in the second half of 2004 on emissions projections of Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) |  as a contribution to the preparation of their fourth national communications. The workshop would cover methods |  assumptions |  indicators |  key parameters of models and sensitivity analysis |  and dissemination of methodologies.

It requested the secretariat |  subject to availability of resources |  to organize a workshop in on this topic the first half of 2005. It requested the secretariat to compile information on national systems for the preparation of national GHG inventories included in national inventory reports and inventory review reports as an input to this workshop |  as part of its consideration of Articles 5 |  7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol. B. Greenhouse gas inventories (Agenda item 4 (b)) 1. Proceedings 15. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 1st and 6th meetings |  on 1 and 9 December |  respectively. It had before it documents FCCC/SBSTA/2003/14 and Corr.1 |  FCCC/SBSTA/2003/INF.10 and FCCC/TP/2003/3. Parties were informed that more detailed data |  complementing document FCCC/SBSTA/2003/14 and Corr.1 |  are published on the secretariat web site in document FCCC/WEB/2003/3. Statements were made by representatives of 10 Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States and of Hungary |  Lithuania |  Malta |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2003/15 English Page 8 and Poland. Statements were also made by representatives from the IPCC and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 16. At its 1st meeting |  the SBSTA agreed to consider this sub-item in informal consultations convened by the SBSTA Chair with the assistance of Ms. Helen Plume (New Zealand). At the 6th meeting |  Ms. Plume reported on these consultations. 2. Conclusions 17. At its 6th meeting |  on 9 December |  having considered a proposal by the Chair |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions:5 Methodological issues (a) The SBSTA considered the initial information on methodological issues relating to the preparation of national GHG inventories by Parties |  contained in document FCCC/SBSTA/2003/INF.10. It noted that this document provides important background information to support the work of the IPCC on the development of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (2006 IPCC Guidelines) and decided to forward it to the IPCC for consideration; (b) The SBSTA noted the information provided by the IPCC on the terms of reference |  table of contents and work programme for the development of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines; (c) The SBSTA requested the secretariat to continue to cooperate with the IPCC and provide more detailed information based on the latest available GHG inventory submissions by Parties and the results of the technical review of GHG inventories. Such information could serve as input to the planned IPCC meetings that will take place during the development of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines; Emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transportation (d) The SBSTA noted the information provided by the ICAO on the issues that will be addressed during the sixth meeting of the Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP6). The SBSTA noted the ongoing exchange of information with the ICAO and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and encouraged this to continue where appropriate. It invited the ICAO to report on the results of CAEP6 to the SBSTA at its twentieth session. The SBSTA also invited the IMO to report to the SBSTA at its twentieth session on the results of the meeting of the Marine Environment Protection Committee to be held in March 2004; (e) The SBSTA took note of the information contained in document FCCC/TP/2003/3. It also took note of the status of two new models (AERO2K and SAGE) that are being developed. Recalling the invitation made at its eighteenth session and noting the relevant provisions of the Convention and of the Kyoto Protocol |  the SBSTA invited the ICAO to encourage the developers of these two models to complete them as soon as possible so that the resulting data are available preferably by 1 March 2004; (f) The SBSTA recalled its conclusions from its eighteenth session and recognized the importance of reliable inventory data for further work on the implementation of decision 2/CP.3. It agreed to continue consideration of inventory issues relating to this decision at its twenty-second session; |  |  |  | 5 |  |  |  | Adopted as FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.28 as amended orally at the 6th meeting. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2003/15 English Page 9 Report on national GHG inventory data from Annex I Parties for the period 1990–2001 (g) The SBSTA considered the information on GHG emissions and removals from Annex I Parties contained in document FCCC/SBSTA/2003/14. It noted that the data |  although preliminary |  indicate that total aggregate GHG emissions for Annex I Parties as a whole declined by about 7 per cent between 1990 and 2001 |  due primarily to a 40 per cent decline in emissions from Parties with economies in transition. It also noted that emissions from some Annex I Parties have increased since 1990; (h) The SBSTA noted with appreciation the substantial improvement in quality and timing of submissions of GHG inventories |  including national inventory reports |  by most Annex I Parties; (i) The SBSTA noted that some Annex I Parties still meet difficulties with regard to timeliness of the GHG inventory submissions. The SBSTA noted that some Annex I Parties have not provided a GHG inventory in 2003 |  and some Annex I Parties submitted their GHG inventory well after the 15 April submission date. The SBSTA further noted with concern that a few Annex I Parties have not submitted GHG inventory data for years more recent than 1996. The SBSTA also noted that the GHG inventories from some Annex I Parties are not fully transparent or are not complete; (j) The SBSTA noted the improvement in reporting of GHG inventories by most Annex I Parties and urged Parties that have not fully followed the reporting requirements identified in decision 3/CP.5 to continue to improve their reporting |  especially their national inventory reports |  and to make every effort to submit their complete GHG inventories |  including a national inventory report |  by 15 April of each year. It also noted that for inventories due in 2004 |  Annex I Parties should follow the requirements identified in decision 18/CP.8. C. Land use |  land-use change and forestry: definitions and modalities for including afforestation and reforestation activities under Article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol (Agenda item 4 (c)) 1. Proceedings 18. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 2nd and 6th meetings |  on 2 and 9 December respectively. It had before it document FCCC/SBSTA/2003/10/Add.3. Statements were made by representatives of 20 Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States and of Hungary |  Lithuania |  Malta and Poland |  one on behalf of the Group of 77 and China |  and one on behalf of AOSIS. Statements were also made by representatives of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). 19. At its 2nd meeting |  the SBSTA agreed to consider this sub-item in a contact group co-chaired by Ms. Thelma Krug (Brazil) and Mr. Karsten Sach (Germany). At the 6th meeting |  Ms. Krug reported on the contact group’s consultations. 20. At the 6th meeting |  in a discussion of the proposed draft decision to be forwarded to the COP |  representatives of four Parties requested that their statements be summarized in the report of the session. The representative of Australia expressed the view that it was not appropriate to single out alien invasive species and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the decision text. He underlined that host Parties have the right to decide how best to use clean development mechanism (CDM) sinks projects |  consistent with their international rights and obligations. The representative of the United States of America expressed the view that nothing in the decision on modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM in the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2003/15 English Page 10 affects the applicability of other international obligations |  including trade obligations |  and referred to its submission on this matter (see FCCC/SBSTA/2003/MISC.5/Add.1). The representative of Canada noted that the conclusion of the difficult negotiations on sinks in the CDM will enable Parties to move forward with projects in advance of the first commitment period |  while expressing concerns about some of the definitions and modalities in the agreement. She also made clear Canada’s view that implementation of the provision on GMOs in the decision was reserved to each Party. She also observed that the COP decision provides for Parties to review how well the agreed definitions and modalities for including afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM are working |  anytime prior to 2011. Canada looks forward to participating in that review and hopes it will provide a practical demonstration of Canada s vision of the role of carbon sinks in addressing climate change. Finally |  the representative of Italy |  speaking on behalf of the European Community and its members States |  noted that they had accepted a compromise on the double accounting system to deal with non-permanence as well as on the agreed approach relating to small-scale CDM afforestation and reforestation projects. He highlighted that the introduction of the socio-economic and environmental analysis made the agreement acceptable in the light of the environmental integrity of the Kyoto Protocol. 2. Conclusions 21. At its 6th meeting |  on 9 December |  having considered a proposal by the Chair |  the SBSTA recommended a draft decision on this subject (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27) for adoption by the COP at its ninth session.6 D.

OPENING OF THE SESSION (Agenda item 1) 1. The seventh session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) was held at the Beethovenhalle |  Bonn |  from 20 to 28 October 1997. 2. At the 1st meeting on 20 October 1997 |  the Chairman of the SBSTA |  Mr. Tibor Faragó (Hungary) |  opened the session and welcomed all delegates as well as observers from non-parties |  United Nations bodies and organizations |  and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and wished the participants a successful session. He urged delegates to make efficient use of the time allocated and to conclude the negotiations in a timely manner. He further noted that this was the last session of the SBSTA before the third session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 3) and |  therefore |  the last opportunity for the SBSTA to make recommendations for decisions to be adopted at COP 3. |  |  |  | II. ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS (Agenda item 2) A. Adoption of the agenda (Agenda item 2 (a)) 3. At its 1st meeting |  on 20 October 1997 |  the SBSTA considered the provisional agenda contained in document FCCC/SBSTA/1997/7 |  and adopted the following agenda: 1. 2. Opening of the session. Organizational matters: (a) (b) (c) Adoption of the agenda; Organization of the work of the session; Preparations by the SBSTA for the third session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 3). |  |  |  | 3. 4. |  |  |  | Co-operation with relevant international organizations. National communications: (a) (b) Communications from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention; Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention. |  |  |  | 5. |  |  |  | Methodological issues. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1997/14 English Page 5 6. Development and transfer of technologies: (a) (b) 7. 8. 9. Programme of work; Activities by Annex II Parties regarding the transfer of technologies. |  |  |  | Roster of experts. Activities implemented jointly under the pilot phase. Report on the session. B. Organization of the work of the session (Agenda item 2 (b)) |  |  |  | 4. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 1st meeting |  on 20 October |  during which the Chairman recalled the need to start on time as otherwise services for interpretation would be lost. Full conference services would be available for one morning and one afternoon meeting from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. The Chairman recalled that a roundtable on activities implemented jointly under the pilot phase had been scheduled for the evening of 20 October and an informal meeting with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the Third Assessment Report (TAR) had been scheduled for the afternoon of 22 October. 5. The SBSTA agreed to the Chairman’s proposal to amend the suggested approach to the organization of work contained in the annotations to the provisional agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/7) by taking up additional items at its first meeting. 6. The Chairman informed the SBSTA that applications for observer status from three intergovernmental and 21 non-governmental organizations had been screened by the secretariat on the basis of the provisions of Article 7.6 of the Convention and in accordance with the procedures established by the COP for the admission of organizations (see document FCCC/SB/1997/INF.4). The SBSTA agreed to grant these organizations access to the current session of the SBSTA |  pending formal action on their accreditation by the COP at its third session. 7. The SBSTA also agreed to the Chairman’s proposal to follow the recommendations on the division of labour between the SBSTA and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) that were agreed by both bodies at their sixth sessions |  and consequently to allow one body to take overall responsibility in considering an issue. Specific inputs from the other body would be obtained by establishing informal joint working groups. It was agreed therefore to establish joint working groups on the development and transfer of technologies and on activities implemented jointly under the pilot phase |  agenda items for which the SBSTA would take the overall responsibility. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1997/14 English Page 6 C. Preparations by the SBSTA for the third session of the Conference of the Parties (Agenda item 2 (c)) 8. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 1st and 4th meetings |  on 20 and 28 October respectively. At the 1st meeting |  the SBSTA agreed to forward to COP 3 recommendations of draft decisions for adoption. At its 4th meeting |  the Chairman recalled that Article 9.1 provides |  inter alia |  that the SBSTA “shall report regularly to the Conference of the Parties on all aspects of its work”. In that connection |  the SBSTA requested its Chairman to present to COP 3 the reports of the SBSTA on the work of all of its sessions since the second session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 2) |  namely |  its fourth |  fifth |  sixth and seventh sessions. D. Attendance 9. The seventh session of the SBSTA was attended by representatives of 127 Parties and by observers from 6 States not parties to the Convention. It was also attended by representatives of 8 United Nations offices and programmes |  7 specialized agencies |  5 intergovernmental organizations and 122 non-governmental organizations1. E. Documentation 10. The documents before the SBSTA at its seventh session are listed in annex III below. |  |  |  | III. CO-OPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS (Agenda item 3) 1. Proceedings 11. The SBSTA considered this item at its 3rd and 4th meetings |  on 24 and 28 October respectively. It had before it documents FCCC/SBSTA/1997/8 and FCCC/SBSTA/1997/MISC.6. These documents contained reports prepared by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) on the monitoring of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere and on the International Conference on the World Climate Research Programme |  as requested by the SBSTA at its fourth and fifth sessions. The documents were introduced by representatives of the WMO |  who also provided an oral report on the status of the Global Climate Observing System. Two additional documents |  the Special Report on Regional Impacts of Climate Change and Technical Paper 4 on Implications of Proposed CO2 Emissions Limitations |  were made available by the secretariat of the IPCC. |  |  |  | 1 |  |  |  | For the full list of participants |  see document FCCC/1997/INF.4. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1997/14 English Page 7 12. At the 3rd meeting |  on 24 October |  statements were made by the Chairman and the Chairman Emeritus of the IPCC |  both of whom also responded to questions. Statements were made by representatives of 20 Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. Statements were also made by representatives of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Technology and Economic Assessment Panel under the Montreal Protocol. 13. Two informal meetings were organized with the IPCC on the Third Assessment Report (TAR) and on Technical Paper 4 on Implications of Proposed CO2 Emissions Limitations |  on 23 and 28 October |  respectively. A report on the outcome of the first informal meeting was made by its Rapporteur |  at the 3rd meeting of the SBSTA on 24 October |  and a report on the outcome of the second informal meeting was made by its Chairman at the 4th meeting of the SBSTA on 28 October. 2. Conclusions 14. At its 4th meeting |  on 28 October |  having considered a proposal by the Chairman |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA noted with appreciation the information provided by the Chairman and the Chairman Emeritus of the IPCC in relation to the conclusions of the thirteenth session of that body |  particularly regarding the structure and content of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) |  and noted with satisfaction the regional emphasis and the arrangements made for further involvement of experts from developing countries. It also noted the election of the new IPCC Bureau. (b) The SBSTA also noted with appreciation the information given at the informal meeting organized by the secretariat and the IPCC on key issues that Parties wished to have included in the TAR |  particularly in its synthesis report (for the list of issues |  see annex II below). In that connection |  it recalled that |  at its sixth session |  it had invited Parties to submit to the secretariat |  before 20 January 1998 |  additional information on key policy issues to be addressed in the TAR |  and that some Parties had already submitted the comments contained in FCCC/SBSTA/1997/MISC.4. The information compiled would be made available through the Joint Working Group of officers of the Convention bodies and of the IPCC. (c) The SBSTA took note of the IPCC Special Report on Regional Impacts of Climate Change and the IPCC Technical Paper 4 on Implications of Proposed CO2 Emissions Limitations |  requested by the SBSTA. The latter paper was prepared in response to the request by the SBSTA to provide an assessment of the implications for projected temperature increases |  sea level rise and other changes in climate of different proposals for the limitation of greenhouse gas emissions by Annex I Parties. The SBSTA took note of the differing views and concerns expressed with regard to Technical Paper 4 and drew the paper to the attention of the other bodies of the Convention. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1997/14 English Page 8 (d) The SBSTA noted the progress in the preparation of the IPCC special reports on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere |  Methodological and Technological Aspects of Technology Transfer: Opportunities for Technology Co-operation |  and Emission Scenarios |  and requested the IPCC to complete those reports as soon as feasible. (e) The SBSTA noted with appreciation the reports provided by the WMO in response to its requests at its fourth and fifth sessions |  which covered the following subjects: (i) Monitoring of GHGs in the atmosphere; |  |  |  | (ii) Report on and statement from the International Conference on the World Climate Research Programme: Achievements |  Benefits and Challenges |  held at Geneva |  26-28 August 1997; (iii) Status of the Global Climate Observing System. |  |  |  | (f) The SBSTA underlined the importance of the systematic observation and monitoring of GHGs and components of the climate system |  and the need for adequate global coverage to provide basic information for scientific studies on the impact on the climate system of changes in atmospheric composition. The SBSTA agreed to consider further this issue at its next session. (g) The SBSTA expressed its appreciation to those Parties already operating stations for the monitoring of GHGs |  as well as to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for its support in the establishment and operation of several stations. (h) The SBSTA invited the relevant international organizations to continue their valuable work in support of the Convention process through the provision of periodic reports to the SBSTA |  and |  in particular |  to identify gaps that developing countries faced in the following areas: (i) Endogenous capacity to monitor and assess important climate change parameters; (ii) Systematic observational networks to identify the possible onset and distribution of climate change and assess potential impacts |  particularly at the regional level. (i) The SBSTA also noted the message by the International Conference on the World Climate Research Programme to the Conference of the Parties contained in FCCC/SBSTA/1997/MISC.6. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1997/14 English Page 9 (j) The SBSTA also noted with appreciation the information provided by the UNEP Technology and Economic Assessment Panel under the Montreal Protocol and by the International Civil Aviation Organization. (k) The SBSTA decided to recommend for adoption by the Conference of the Parties at its third session |  a draft decision on co-operation with the IPCC and a draft decision on the development of observational networks of the climate system (for the texts of these draft decisions |  see annex I below). |  |  |  | IV. NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS (Agenda item 4) A. Communications from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Agenda item 4 (a)) 1. Proceedings 15. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 1st and 3rd meetings |  on 20 and 24 October respectively. It had before it the following documents: FCCC/SBSTA/1997/13; FCCC/SB/1997/6; FCCC/SBI/1997/19 and Add.1; and FCCC/SBI/1997/INF.4. Statements were made by representatives of nine Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. 2. Conclusions 16. At its 3rd meeting |  on 24 October |  having considered a proposal by the Chairman |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA took note of the documents prepared by the secretariat related to this agenda sub-item |  in particular |  an annex on methodological issues contained in document FCCC/SBI/1997/19. It invited Parties to submit to the secretariat by 15 March 1998 their views on possible approaches aimed at resolving those methodological issues |  and requested the secretariat to compile them for consideration at its eighth session. (b) The SBSTA recalled decision 9/CP.2 |  requesting Annex I Parties to submit their national inventory data on an annual basis by 15 April of each year. In addition |  the SBSTA invited Annex I Parties to make available to the secretariat by 6 June 1998 |  for purposes of comparison and transparency |  their complete 1996 GHG inventories obtained using |  when possible |  best available methodologies and those obtained using the current IPCC default methodologies. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to draw upon the roster of experts to |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1997/14 English Page 10 analyse and compare the results and assess the adequacy of information and the implications for meeting emissions limitation or reduction objectives |  and to make them available for its ninth session. (c) The SBSTA requested the secretariat to prepare |  for consideration at its ninth session |  a document listing methodological issues identified by the secretariat while processing national GHG inventories and in the course of in-depth reviews |  taking into account the submissions from Parties. (d) The SBSTA agreed to consider at its ninth session what |  if any |  additions and/or amendments to the revised UNFCCC guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Annex I Parties would be required |  taking into account the results of the above-mentioned activities |  together with inputs from other bodies |  such as the IPCC. (e) The SBSTA forwarded to the SBI a text for inclusion as operative paragraph 1 of a draft decision on this sub-item to be recommended by the SBI for adoption by the COP at its third session (for the text of the draft decision |  see document FCCC/SBI/1997/21 |  annex I). |  |  |  | B. Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (Agenda item 4 (b)) 17. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 1st meeting |  on 20 October. It noted that |  as was indicated in the annotations to the provisional agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/7 |  para. 18) |  in view of the agreed division of labour |  this item would be discussed by the SBI. Since there were no methodological issues under this sub-item that needed to be addressed at the current session |  there was |  therefore |  no need for an input from the SBSTA. |  |  |  | V. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES (Agenda item 5) 1. Proceedings 18. The SBSTA considered this item at its 2nd |  3rd and 4th meetings |  on 21 |  24 and 28 October respectively. It had before it the following documents: FCCC/SBSTA/1997/9 and FCCC/1997/TP/2. 19. At its 2nd meeting |  on 21 October |  the Chairman informed the SBSTA that he had received a communication from the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM) requesting the SBSTA to consider some methodological issues raised by Parties in their submissions to the AGBM. As several delegations considered it more appropriate to address these issues later |  subsequent to any agreement on a protocol or another legal |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1997/14 English Page 11 instrument |  the Chairman decided to draw the attention of the Chairman of the AGBM to earlier related conclusions of the SBSTA (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/20 |  paras. 30 and 54) and decision 9/CP.2. 20. Statements were made by representatives of nine Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and another speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. 2. Conclusions 21. At its 4th meeting |  on 28 October |  having considered a proposal by the Chairman |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA recalled decision 9/CP.2 |  which states that if Parties carry out any adjustments to inventory data |  for example for climate variations or trade patterns in electricity |  these adjustments should be reported in a transparent manner |  with a clear indication of the method followed. Both adjusted and unadjusted data should be provided. The SBSTA also recalled that |  at its fourth session |  it had stressed the necessity of reporting inventories in mass units without adjustments |  according to the guidelines |  and had concluded that adjustments were to be regarded as important information in relation to the monitoring of emission trends and the performance of policies and measures |  and should be reported separately (see FCCC/SBSTA/1996/20). (b) On the basis of the information in document FCCC/SBSTA/1997/9 |  the SBSTA further concluded that weather adjustments |  in particular temperature adjustments |  to national GHG inventories and projections might be a useful tool to understand the factors influencing emissions and to assess the effectiveness of policies and measures. For those purposes |  individual Parties may choose whether adjustments are applied |  in addition to reporting unadjusted inventory data |  and |  if so |  which methods are chosen. The SBSTA encouraged Parties to share with others their experiences with the application of adjustments. (c) The SBSTA noted that the information in document FCCC/SBSTA/1997/9 and FCCC/TP/1997/2 might have a bearing on the work of the SBI and AGBM and invited those bodies to consider that information in their work. (d) The SBSTA noted with appreciation the decision of the IPCC at its thirteenth session to accelerate work on uncertainties related to GHG inventories in the IPCC/OECD/IEA programme |  as requested by the SBSTA at its sixth session. (e) The SBSTA requested the secretariat to prepare a report that aimed to identify the gaps faced by developing countries in the areas of research on |  and development of |  methodologies related to the preparation of inventories of emissions from sources and removals |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1997/14 English Page 12 by sinks |  with a view to obtaining the highest quality information needed to reduce scientific uncertainty while maintaining comparability. VI. DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES (Agenda item 6) A. Programme of work (Agenda item 6 (a)) 1. Proceedings 22. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 2nd and 4th meetings |  on 21 and 28 October respectively. It had before it the following documents: FCCC/SBSTA/1997/10; FCCC/SBSTA/1997/INF.5 and FCCC/TP/1997/3. An additional document |  the Preliminary Review of Existing Technology Information Centres and Networks |  was also made available by the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI). 23. Statements were made by representatives of seven Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. A statement was also made by a representative of the Parties co-operating in the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI). 2. Conclusions 24. At its 4th meeting |  on 28 October |  having considered a proposal made by the Chairman on the basis of inputs from a joint working group established by the SBSTA and the SBI |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA took note with appreciation of the progress report on development and transfer of technologies prepared by the secretariat (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/10) |  of the technical report with an overview of adaptation technologies (FCCC/TP/1997/3) |  and the preliminary review of existing technology information centres and networks prepared by the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI). (b) The SBSTA welcomed the activities of the secretariat |  in co-operation with the University of Amsterdam (IVAM Environmental Research) |  to expand the survey of technology and technology information needs to all non-Annex I Parties |  and requested the latter to cooperate with the secretariat in its completion. (c) The SBSTA noted the need to accelerate the process of providing information on technologies. With respect to the first level of options in document FCCC/SBSTA/1997/10 |  para. 44 |  it suggested that the International Energy Agency (IEA) should seek means to open GREENTIE to participation by all Parties |  and requested the secretariat to explore options to enhance support for training |  in non-Annex II Parties |  in the use of information technologies. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1997/14 English Page 13 (d) The SBSTA urged Parties to provide comments on (an) international centre(s) |  including their possible functions as well as institutional and financial arrangements |  by 30 March 1998 |  to be compiled into a miscellaneous document. It requested the secretariat to further update information on the topic for the next session. (e) The SBSTA requested the SBI to consider options for funding (an) international centre(s) and enhancing support for national or regional centres. In that context it called upon the secretariat to consult with the GEF and other relevant international organizations and solicit information on their capabilities and abilities to support the work of (an) international technology information centre(s) |  as well as national and regional centres; and enhance support for national and regional centres |  and to report to the SBSTA and the SBI on its findings. 25. The SBSTA decided to recommend for adoption by the Conference of the Parties at its third session |  a draft decision on the development and transfer of technologies |  which includes elements relating to agenda sub-item 6 (b) (for the text of the draft decision |  see annex I below). |  |  |  | B. Activities by Annex II Parties regarding the transfer of technologies (Agenda item 6 (b)) 1. Proceedings 26. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 2nd and 4th meetings |  on 21 and 28 October |  respectively. It had before it document FCCC/SBSTA/1997/13. 27. Statements were made by representatives of eight Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. 2. Conclusions 28. At its 4th meeting |  on 28 October |  having considered a proposal made by the Chairman on the basis of inputs from a joint working group established by the SBSTA and the SBI |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA took note with appreciation of the document prepared by the secretariat on activities of Parties included in Annex II related to transfer of technology (FCCC/SBSTA/1997/13) |  which was based on second national communications. (b) The SBSTA requested all Annex II Parties that had not submitted their second national communications to follow the reporting guidelines |  and urged those Parties that had already submitted their second communications to provide supplementary information on finance and transfer of technology |  if their initial information was incomplete. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1997/14 English Page 14 (c) The SBSTA took note of the need for better information with respect to finance and transfer of technology and agreed to consider at its ninth session what |  if any |  additions and/or amendments to the revised guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Annex II Parties would be required. It invited Parties to submit to the secretariat by 15 March 1998 their views on reporting information on finance and transfer of technology and requested the secretariat to compile them for consideration at its eighth session. It also urged the secretariat to explore other means of obtaining such information |  including the in-depth reviews of national communications. |  |  |  | VII. ROSTER OF EXPERTS (Agenda item 7) 1. Proceedings 29. The SBSTA considered this item at its 1st |  2nd |  3rd and 4th meetings |  on 20 |  21 |  24 and 28 October |  respectively. It had before it the following documents: FCCC/SBSTA/1997/11 and FCCC/SBSTA/1997/INF.6. 30. Statements were made by representatives of 19 Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States and another speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. 2. Conclusions 31. At its 4th meeting |  on 28 October |  having considered a proposal made by the Chairman |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA noted the need for the provision of technical inputs to its work on methodological and technological issues. In this connection |  Parties considered the issues of the use of the roster of experts and the use of the intergovernmental technical advisory panels. (b) The SBSTA recalled its intention |  as agreed at its fourth session |  to expand the roster to include experts in the field of methodologies |  and requested the secretariat to seek additional nominees with methodological expertise from Parties |  reflecting the priority areas in the work programme. Recognizing that there were still gaps in some of the areas of expertise in the roster |  particularly as regards individuals with backgrounds related to the economic and financial aspects of transfer of technology and know-how |  such as bilateral aid programmes |  multilateral lending and private-sector banking |  the SBSTA encouraged Parties to nominate additional experts in relevant fields. For any tasks identified in the future programme of work of the SBSTA |  Parties should be asked to nominate further experts. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1997/14 English Page 15 (c) The SBSTA concluded that the areas of expertise currently covered in the roster would suggest that |  in addition to other uses of the roster |  experts might provide the SBSTA with advice on particular tasks relating to technological and methodological issues |  including the preparation and review of reports. It noted that rosters maintained by other IGOs also provided lists of experts with experience relevant to the work of the Convention secretariat. (d) The SBSTA requested the secretariat |  in utilizing experts on the roster for its work |  to take into account the following criteria: (i) That the experts should have a professional background relevant to the issues/subjects; (ii) That the roster should be regularly updated |  on the basis of submissions from Parties |  particularly taking into account projects/tasks defined by the SBSTA; (iii) (iv) That a balanced regional representation should be maintained; That the element of capacity building should be fully respected. |  |  |  | (e) The SBSTA requested the secretariat to review its standardized form for collecting information on nominees to the roster of experts and decided to consider this form and the data base generated from its use |  at its eighth session. (f) The SBSTA also requested the secretariat to report annually on the following data with respect to the roster of experts (including any changes in these data): (i) The application of the criteria adopted to select the experts; |  |  |  | (ii) The regional participation of experts by task |  with a breakdown of participation by country; (iii) Regional participation and promotion of capacity building. |  |  |  | (g) The SBSTA concluded that |  to date |  there had not been sufficient experience to fully evaluate the utility of the roster or its use by the secretariat. It therefore requested the secretariat to continue using the roster when providing the SBSTA with advice on technologies and methodologies |  and to prepare a further evaluation of the roster for submission to the Conference of the Parties at its fifth session. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1997/14 English Page 16 VIII.

Most of this work has been anticipated and is already covered in the programme budget for 2010–2011 or the proposal for 2012–2013. However |  the following new activities require additional financial resources: (a) Under agenda item 3 |  “Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change” |  the secretariat has been requested to carry out a number of activities |  one of which is the preparation of a technical paper on water and climate change |  which will require additional resources of around EUR 20 | 000; (b) Under agenda item 4 |  “Methodological guidance for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation |  sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries” |  the SBSTA has requested the secretariat to organize meetings of technical experts |  including a meeting before its thirty-fifth session. Estimated costs will need to be determined after this session; (c) Under agenda item 6 |  “Research and systematic observation” |  the secretariat has been asked to organize further workshops in periodic consultation with research programmes and organizations. The number and scheduling of these workshops is not yet known; (d) Under agenda item 8 |  “Matters relating to Article 2 |  paragraph 3 |  of the Kyoto Protocol” |  the SBSTA has recalled its request to the secretariat to organize a joint workshop on this issue with SBI agenda item 10 |  “Matters relating to Article 3 |  paragraph 14 |  of the Kyoto Protocol” |  which will cost in the region of EUR 100 | 000; (e) Under agenda sub-item 9(c) |  “Greenhouse gas data interface” |  Parties requested the secretariat to enhance the presentation of data in the modules of the interface |  which will require around EUR 20 | 000 to carry out; (f) Under agenda sub-item 10(c) |  “Common metrics to calculate the CO2 equivalence of greenhouse gases” |  the secretariat has been asked to organize a workshop on common metrics in the first half of 2012. Estimated costs are not yet known but will be communicated to interested Parties after this session. 120. At the same meeting |  closing statements were made by nine Parties |  including statements on behalf of the Umbrella Group |  the European Union and its member States |  the Group of 77 and China |  EIG |  the African Group |  the LDCs and AOSIS. Statements were also made on behalf of business and industry non-governmental organizations (NGOs) |  indigenous peoples organizations |  trade union NGOs |  women and gender NGOs and youth NGOs |  and by representatives of environmental NGOs. |  |  |  | 52 |  |  |  | While decision 16/CP.9 refers to “decisions” |  it also has implications for conclusions of the subsidiary bodies. 21 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2011/2 |  |  |  | 121. Before closing the session |  the Chair thanked delegates |  the chairs of contact groups and convenors of informal consultations for their contributions. He also thanked the observers for their interest and strong support |  as well as the secretariat and the interpreters for their continuous hard work. |  |  |  | 22 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2011/2 |  |  |  | Annex I |  | Potential activities under the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change |  | 1. Taking into account the objective of the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change |  as contained in decision 2/CP.11 |  and outputs of activities undertaken to date under the Nairobi work programme |  and noting decision 1/CP.16 |  paragraph 12 |  which affirms that enhanced action on adaptation should be undertaken in accordance with the Convention |  should follow a country-driven |  gendersensitive |  participatory and fully transparent approach |  taking into consideration vulnerable groups |  communities and ecosystems |  and should be based on and guided by the best available science and |  as appropriate |  traditional and indigenous knowledge |  with a view to integrating adaptation into relevant social |  economic and environmental policies and actions |  where appropriate |  the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) discussed the following potential activities under the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change: (a) Enhancing the use of indigenous and traditional knowledge and practices for adaptation and the application of gender-sensitive approaches and tools for understanding and assessing impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change; (b) Improving the dissemination of information and knowledge products developed under the Nairobi work programme through |  inter alia: translation of these products into other official United Nations languages |  and calls for action on the training of national focal points in communication skills and strategies; (c) Strengthening sector-specific and cross-sectoral activities to address impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation issues relating to |  inter alia: (i) (ii) Water (including drought |  floods and glacial melt); Food security (including agriculture and subsistence livelihoods); |  |  |  | (iii) Ecosystems (including mountain ecosystems and coastal and marine ecosystems); (iv) Infrastructure and human settlements; |  |  |  | (d) Facilitating the development of |  and access to |  climate data and scenarios appropriate for adaptation planning |  through |  inter alia |  catalysing actions by partner organizations and regional centres; (e) Further developing targeted knowledge products to engage stakeholders and decision makers |  including |  inter alia |  lessons learned with respect to adaptation at different governance levels and in different sectors |  based on knowledge generated under the Nairobi work programme |  and syntheses of information generated under the Nairobi work programme into knowledge products targeted at users in specific sectors or other thematic areas; (f) Enhancing knowledge on the economic aspects of adaptation through |  inter alia |  pilot projects on applying different methods and tools for assessing the costs and benefits of adaptation (and the documentation and sharing of lessons learned from these projects) |  calls for action and further activities on reducing reliance on vulnerable economic sectors |  including through economic diversification; |  |  |  | 23 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2011/2 |  |  |  | (g) Building capacity through |  inter alia |  the provision of ‘train the trainer’ activities |  for example on the use of methods and tools |  calls for action and collaboration with |  inter alia |  the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention |  the Least Developed Countries Expert Group and partner organizations. 2. Activities under the Nairobi work programme should be consistent with the mandate of the SBSTA. |  |  |  | 24 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2011/2 |  |  |  | Annex II |  | General guidance for submissions and future work regarding: guidance on systems for providing information on how safeguards referred to in appendix I to decision 1/CP.16 are addressed and respected; modalities relating to forest reference emission levels and forest reference levels; and modalities for measuring |  reporting and verifying |  as referred to in appendix II to decision 1/CP.16 |  | 1.

Decides that the concept of materiality should be applied in a consistent manner under the clean development mechanism; 2. Defines material information as a piece of information whose omission or misstatement |  or erroneous reporting |  could change a decision by the Executive Board of the clean development mechanism [on the registration of a project activity or the issuance of certified emission reductions]; [3. Decides that the scope of materiality [only] covers [data] [the stage[s] of [validation | ]] verification |  [for emission reduction project activities] [including the assessment] by designated operational entities |  the Executive Board of the clean development mechanism and its support structure |  [non-prescriptive [and prescriptive] requirements |  and quantitative [as well as qualitative] information;]] [with a view to possibly broadening the scope at a later date;] Option 1: 4. Also decides that information related to a clean development mechanism project shall be considered material if its omission [or] misstatement or [the non-compliance with a requirement] [erroneous reporting] might lead |  at an aggregated level |  to an overestimation of the total emission reductions [or removals] achieved by a clean development mechanism project activity equal to or higher than: (a) [X1] [0.5] per cent of the emission reductions [or removals] for project activities achieving a total emission reduction [or removal] of more than [Y] [500 | 000] tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year; (b) [X2] [2] per cent of the emission reductions [or removals] for large-scale project activities achieving a total emission reduction [or removal] of [Y] [500 | 000] tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year or less; (c) [X3] [5] per cent of the emission reductions [or removals] for small-scale project activities other than projects covered under paragraph 4(d) below; (d) [X4] [10] per cent of the emission reductions [or removals] for the type of project activities that are referred to in decision 3/CMP.6 |  paragraph 38. Option 2: 4. Requests the Executive Board of the clean development mechanism to adopt appropriate quantitative thresholds to define when the omission or misstatement of |  |  |  | 26 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2011/2 |  |  |  | information or the non-compliance with a requirement related to a clean development mechanism project shall be considered material |  taking into account the total amount of emission reductions [or removals] achieved by the project activity; 5. [Also decides that the emission reduction thresholds and the materiality thresholds shall be reviewed [by the Executive Board of the clean development mechanism] based on data reported [by designated operational entities] no later than one year after their implementation;] 6. Decides that the designated operational entity conducting the [validation or] verification shall use a reasonable level of assurance in considering whether or not the information is material; 7. Requests the Executive Board of the clean development mechanism: |  |  |  | (a) To implement the concept of materiality |  adhering to the principles established in paragraphs 1–5 above |  and to report to the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol |  at its eighth session |  on the experiences gained with the implementation of the concept; (b) To increase its interaction with designated operational entities in order to facilitate a uniform interpretation and application of the concept of materiality by developing guidance |  inter alia |  on how to calculate the thresholds and on what should be done if the materiality thresholds are surpassed |  with the overall view of increasing transparency and efficiency and reducing costs; (c) To address the issue of uncertainties of measurements in baseline and monitoring methodologies |  so that these types of uncertainties do not need to be considered in addressing materiality. [8. Also invites the Executive Board of the clean development mechanism to develop guidance on de minimis sources |  which are defined as sources of emissions that do not require monitoring and verification.]] |  |  |  | 27 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2011/2 |  |  |  | Annex IV |  | Documents before the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice at its thirty-fourth session |  | Documents prepared for the session FCCC/SBSTA/2011/1 and Add.1 and 2 FCCC/SBSTA/2011/INF.1 Provisional agenda and annotations.

The SBSTA took note of the information contained in the technical paper 46 prepared by the secretariat on the current review processes under the Convention and the secretariat’s experience with coordinating reviews of national communications and annual GHG inventories of Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties). 76. The SBSTA also took note of: (a) The submissions from Parties on the elements of the work programme |  the timeline of proposed activities and the key elements of the revision of the review guidelines;47 (b) The synthesis report on these submissions.48 77. The SBSTA agreed on the work programme on the revision of the review guidelines |  as contained in annex I to this report |  with specific timelines and activities for 2013 and 2014. However |  the SBSTA noted that while the revision of review guidelines for national communications and biennial reports will be completed by COP 19 |  the revision of review guidelines for GHG inventories can only be completed by COP 20. Although the activities related to the revision of the review guidelines on national communications and biennial reports contained in the work programme are currently considered in conjunction |  the SBSTA agreed that the work programme should ensure delineation between the review guidelines on biennial reports and review guidelines on national communications. 78. The SBSTA agreed that in their consideration of the activities under the work programme on the revision of the review guidelines |  Parties should take into account the experience with the review of information submitted by Annex I Parties under the Convention |  including the submissions from Parties |  the synthesis reports on these submissions and the secretariat’s experience with coordinating reviews of national communications and annual GHG inventories of Annex I Parties |  and the need to have a cost-effective |  efficient and practical review process that does not impose an excessive burden on Parties |  experts or the secretariat. 79. The SBSTA requested the lead reviewers to discuss |  at their meeting in 2013 |  options to improve the cost-effectiveness |  efficiency and practicality of the review process |  and requested the secretariat to make the outcome of their discussions available as inputs to discussions at SBSTA 38. 80.

The SBSTA expressed its appreciation to the regional and international climate change research programmes and organizations (hereinafter referred to as research programmes and organizations) and to the IPCC for the valuable updated information on developments in research activities and on emerging scientific findings relevant to the Convention. This information was provided during the meeting that |  |  |  | 20 21 |  |  |  | <http://unfccc.int/methods_science/redd/items/4531.php>. Adopted as document FCCC/SBSTA/2009/L.6. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2009/3 Page 11 took place during SBSTA 30 as part of the research dialogue in the context of decision 9/CP.11 22 and in the submissions compiled in document FCCC/SBSTA/2009/MISC.5. The SBSTA took note of a list prepared by the secretariat of international and regional programmes and organizations active in areas of research relevant to climate change. 23 48. The SBSTA affirmed the valuable role of the research dialogue in providing new scientific information that emerges from climate change research in between publication of the IPCC Assessment Reports. It also noted the importance of such information for informing deliberations within the UNFCCC process. The SBSTA invited the research programmes and organizations to continue to provide |  as part of the research dialogue |  information on developments in the research activities outlined in document FCCC/SBSTA/2007/4 |  paragraph 47 (a–f). It requested the secretariat to make the presentations that are given as part of the dialogue available on the UNFCCC website in such a way that they can be reached by a wide audience. 49. The SBSTA agreed that meetings under this dialogue should be continued |  during the thirty-second and subsequent sessions of the SBSTA |  and organized in such a way that more time is devoted both to in-depth consideration by Parties of new scientific findings and developments in research activities and to presentations by Parties. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to make arrangements accordingly when organizing meetings under the dialogue. 50. The SBSTA invited Parties to provide to the secretariat |  by 22 March 2010 |  their views on topics to be discussed at the dialogue meeting to take place during SBSTA 32 |  taking into account developments in research activities outlined in document FCCC/SBSTA/2007/4 |  paragraph 47 (a–f). 51. The SBSTA welcomed the information from the IPCC regarding its plans for the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). It recalled its conclusions from its twenty-ninth session |  which noted that Parties may provide information on scientific and technical questions that they wish to be considered in the AR5 process through their IPCC focal points. 24 52. The SBSTA encouraged the research programmes and organizations to continue to undertake further studies to enhance the understanding of climate change and to address key uncertainties identified in the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC |  and to enhance their efforts towards greater integration of climate-related research across all disciplines. It also encouraged the research programmes and organizations to further enhance their activities relating to developing countries. 53. The SBSTA encouraged Parties and research programmes and organizations to enhance their existing efforts to build capacity for research in developing countries |  in particular those aimed at supporting adaptation efforts such as those identified as part of the ongoing activities of the Nairobi work programme. 54. The SBSTA expressed its appreciation for the report on progress with the Implementation Plan for the Global Observing System for Climate in Support of the UNFCCC (hereinafter referred to as the GCOS implementation plan) prepared by the secretariat of GCOS under the guidance of the GCOS |  | 22 |  |  |  | 23 24 |  |  |  | Alongside the IPCC |  the following research programmes and organizations were represented at the meeting: the Earth System Science Partnership |  the World Climate Research Programme |  the International GeosphereBiosphere Programme |  the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change |  DIVERSITAS |  the International Alliance of Research Universities |  START (Global Change System for Analysis |  Research and Training) |  the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research |  the Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research and the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community and associated countries. Further information and presentations are available at <http://unfccc.int/3461.php>. Available at <http://unfccc.int/3461.php>. FCCC/SBSTA/2008/13 |  paragraph 85. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2009/3 Page 12 Steering Committee |  and for the synthesis report on national information on systematic observations for climate. 25 It noted the significant progress made in the implementation of the various observing systems relevant to the Convention |  but also noted that limited progress has been made in filling gaps in in-situ observing systems in developing countries and that the funding available for many important systems is small in relation to what is needed. The SBSTA noted that according to the GCOS progress report |  priority should be given over the next five years to the following: (a) (b) (c) The urgent need for funding support for implementation of the GCOS regional action plans developed during 2001–2006; Immediate attention to the design and implementation of the national and local-scale networks needed for impact assessment and adaptation to climate change; The appointment of GCOS national coordinators in many more than the present 14 countries that have well-established national coordination arrangements for climate observations; Much stronger and higher-level commitment of Parties to the GCOS cooperation mechanism for supporting GCOS implementation in developing countries; Finding new mechanisms for ensuring sustained long-term operation of essential in situ networks |  especially for the oceanic and terrestrial domains |  that are presently supported by project-timescale research funding; Strong support for the further development and promulgation of observational standards for the full range of terrestrial climate variables; Continued encouragement for the coordinated implementation and long-term continuity of the cross-cutting space-based component of GCOS; Strong support for the observational and research-based “Global Framework for Climate Services” proposed for endorsement by World Climate Conference-3; Reaffirmation of the value of detailed national reports on systematic observations under the UNFCCC as a mechanism for fostering |  focusing and guiding GCOS implementation at the national level. |  |  |  | (d) (e) |  |  |  | (f) (g) (h) (i) |  |  |  | 55. The SBSTA urged Parties and invited relevant United Nations agencies and international organizations to take steps to address the priorities and gaps identified in the GCOS progress report |  in particular the implementation of the GCOS regional action plans |  and ensuring a sustained long-term operation of in situ networks |  especially for the oceanic and terrestrial domains. 56. The SBSTA stressed that addressing these priorities would help countries to adapt to climate change on a basis of sound data and information. 57. The SBSTA noted that an updated GCOS implementation plan that takes into account emerging priorities |  such as the need for data for adaptation |  may assist in continuing progress with GCOS implementation. It therefore invited the GCOS secretariat to prepare |  under the guidance of the GCOS Steering Committee |  an update of the GCOS implementation plan before its thirty-third session. 58. The SBSTA invited the GCOS secretariat to include |  in this updated GCOS implementation plan |  a breakdown of costs involved. The costs should be broken down by region |  observing system and between developed and developing countries. The SBSTA invited the GCOS secretariat to provide a |  | 25 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2009/MISC.7 and Add.1. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2009/3 Page 13 provisional updated implementation plan in conjunction with a provisional estimation of costs |  before COP 15 |  and requested the secretariat to make this information available as a miscellaneous document. 59. The SBSTA welcomed the support given to the GCOS secretariat. The SBSTA noted the overall expected increase in workload for the GCOS secretariat that would emerge from addressing the priorities and gaps identified in the GCOS progress report. It therefore invited all of the GCOS sponsoring agencies 26 to consider ways to provide adequate resources for supporting this work. 60. The SBSTA expressed its appreciation for the updated progress report by the secretariat of GTOS on progress made in assessing the status of the development of standards for each of the essential climate variables (ECVs) in the terrestrial domain and on the framework for the preparation of guidance materials |  standards and reporting guidelines for terrestrial observing systems for climate 27 which was further developed following the guidance of the SBSTA at its twenty-seventh session. 28 61. The SBSTA welcomed the proposal contained in the updated progress report for a joint terrestrial framework mechanism between relevant agencies of the United Nations and the International Organization for Standardization |  and encouraged the GTOS secretariat and the GTOS sponsoring agencies to implement the framework. The SBSTA also invited the GTOS secretariat and the GTOS sponsoring agencies to elaborate a work plan for developing observational standards and protocols for the 13 terrestrial ECVs assessed. It invited the GTOS secretariat to report on the results of the implementation of the framework and its elaboration of the work plan at SBSTA 33. 62. The SBSTA expressed its appreciation for the updated report provided by CEOS |  on behalf of Parties that support space agencies involved in global observations |  to the SBSTA at its twenty-ninth session. 29 It welcomed the progress made by those agencies in responding to the GCOS implementation plan and the support of CEOS to the space-based observations of GCOS. The SBSTA further welcomed the commitment by CEOS member agencies to work towards improved availability of current and future data for forest carbon monitoring |  as expressed in a statement delivered by a representative of CEOS. 63. The SBSTA encouraged coordinated implementation of the cross-cutting space-based components of GCOS to continue over the long term |  including the continued coordinated response to the needs identified in the GCOS implementation plan through CEOS. It also encouraged CEOS and the Parties that support space agencies involved in global observations to continue and if possible accelerate development of methodologies |  and validation and inter-comparison of satellite-based applications for the terrestrial domain. The SBSTA invited CEOS to report at its thirty-third session on progress made in its efforts to meet the relevant needs of the Convention. 64. The SBSTA invited the participants of the forthcoming World Climate Conference-3 |  to be held in Geneva |  Switzerland |  from 31 August to 4 September 2009 |  to take note of the needs of the Convention |  in particular with respect to research and systematic observation. It invited WMO to provide information on the outcome of the conference to inform the work under the Convention. 65. The SBSTA invited the AWG-LCA to note the importance of research and systematic observation in underpinning the implementation of the Convention. The SBSTA also invited the AWG-LCA to note that such research and systematic observation needs to be strengthened |  particularly in developing countries. The SBSTA emphasized that any enhanced action on adaptation should take into account the need to strengthen adaptation-related research and systematic observation. The AWG-LCA is invited to take into account such needs in its deliberations. |  | 26 |  |  |  | 27 28 29 |  |  |  | WMO |  the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational |  Scientific and Cultural Organization |  the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Council for Science.

The SBSTA requested the secretariat |  in implementing the activities referred to in paragraph 73 above |  to give priority to the enhanced training activities and the quality assurance of review activities. 75. The SBSTA invited Annex I Parties in a position to do so to provide the necessary supplementary funding for the activities referred to in paragraph 73 above. 76. The SBSTA reiterated its request to Parties to nominate experts to the roster of experts and to update the roster at least once a year. The SBSTA encouraged Parties to make available as many GHG inventory review experts as feasible for the review process. 77. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to add a dedicated page on its website with information on the training for GHG inventory review experts under the Convention |  including procedures for the nomination of experts to the roster of experts |  scheduled courses and examinations. 78. The SBSTA requested lead reviewers to consider |  at their next meeting |  the need to provide more guidance to new GHG inventory review experts on approaches to conducting reviews |  including differences in the level of detail between different types of reviews |  and ways to provide this guidance to new GHG inventory review experts. 79. The SBSTA decided to recommend a draft decision on the training programme for GHG inventory review experts for the technical review of GHG inventories of Annex I Parties |  for adoption by the COP at its fifteenth session. 33 B. Greenhouse gas data interface (Agenda item 7 (b)) 1. Proceedings 80. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 1st and 3rd meetings |  on 1 and 10 June |  respectively. |  |  |  | 81. At its 1st meeting |  the SBSTA agreed to consider this item in informal consultations convened by the Chair with the assistance of Ms. Erasmia Kitou (European Community). At the 3rd meeting |  Ms. Kitou reported on these consultations. 82. At its 3rd meeting |  the SBSTA considered and adopted conclusions 34 proposed by the Chair. 2. Conclusions |  |  |  | 33 34 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2009/L.7/Add.1. For the final text see FCCC/SBSTA/2009/3/Add.1. Adopted as document FCCC/SBSTA/2009/L.4. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2009/3 Page 16 83. The SBSTA welcomed the progress made by the secretariat in further developing the GHG data interface |  including annual updates of inventory data reported by Annex I Parties |  the integration of inventory data reported by non-Annex I Parties in their national communications |  and the provision of access through the interface to activity data and implied emission factors as reported to the secretariat |  35 population and gross domestic product (GDP) data 36 and national emissions data for the base year under the Kyoto Protocol for those Annex I Parties that are also Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. 37 The SBSTA acknowledged that the GHG data interface has become a useful and versatile tool that is actively used for viewing and retrieving GHG inventory data provided by Parties under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. 84. The SBSTA noted that owing to the lack of resources |  the secretariat has not yet included in the interface a function to provide |  in a simple and user-friendly form |  the facility to calculate user-defined indicators from the emissions |  population and GDP data available through the interface. 38 85. The SBSTA |  responding to the request by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol at its fourth session |  39 considered means of providing online access to information contained in the compilation and accounting database. The SBSTA found that the integration of such information into the interface is technically feasible |  and requested the secretariat to include this information in the interface before the thirty-third session of the SBSTA |  subject to the availability of resources. 86. The SBSTA noted that the lack of resources has become a constraint for the implementation of some functions of the interface. It urged Parties in a position to do so to provide resources for the development of the interface. The SBSTA recommended that further improvements to the interface be prioritized in line with the following guiding principles: (a) (b) (c) (d) Continue to update GHG data reported by Annex I Parties in their national inventories and by non-Annex I Parties in their national communications; Continue to develop and improve the quality assurance/quality control procedures in order to minimize errors |  inconsistencies and gaps in the interface; Explore possible ways in which the interface could be updated more frequently in order to correct errors; Include information from the compilation and accounting database as referred to in paragraph 85 above. |  |  |  | 87. The SBSTA agreed to consider |  at its thirty-third session |  matters relating to the interface with a view to evaluating progress and determining next steps. C.

OPENING OF THE SESSION (Agenda item 1) 1. The fifth session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (hereinafter referred to as  the SBSTA ) was held at the Stadthalle Bad Godesberg |  Koblenzer Strasse 80 |  Bonn |  from 25 to 28 February 1997. 2. The Chairman of the SBSTA |  Mr. Tibor Faragó |  opened the session on 25 February 1997. He welcomed all delegates and observers from non-parties |  United Nations bodies and organizations |  and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. 3. The Executive Secretary made a statement in which he noted that this was the first meeting in Bonn |  and that the secretariat had now assumed the responsibilities of setting up and managing conference facilities. He also noted that limited options had been available for the choice of venue |  and as a result |  at the current session |  it had been necessary to set up temporary facilities for some meetings. 4. He regretted that delays in providing documentation had arisen from organizational and staffing problems resulting from relocation |  from the short period of time for preparing documentation since the December 1996 sessions and the constraints on the capacity of the United Nations Office in Geneva |  including its application of the General Assembly rule that a translated document may only be distributed when all six language versions are available. 5. He also highlighted the linkages between the provisional agenda of the SBSTA and those of the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) at their concurrent sessions and the importance of maintaining a coherent overview of the work of the different bodies. 6. Statements were made by representatives of 4 Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. |  |  |  | II. ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS (Agenda item 2) A.

The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by its decision 4/CP.7 |  paragraph 1 |  adopted the framework for meaningful and effective actions to enhance the implementation of Article 4 |  paragraph 5 |  of the Convention contained in the annex to the decision (FCCC/CP/2001/13/Add.1). The framework |  referred to hereinafter as the technology framework |  covers five key themes and areas for actions: technology needs and needs assessments; technology information; enabling environments; capacity-building; and mechanisms for technology transfer. Specific mandates for each activity carried out by the secretariat under some of these themes are provided below. B. Scope of the note 2. This note contains information on ongoing activities of the secretariat in 2002 relating to the implementation of the technology framework |  in particular on technology needs assessments |  development of a technology information system |  establishment of an international information clearing house and networks of technology centres |  and consultations with relevant international organizations on their capacities and abilities to support certain activities identified in the technology framework. 3. Background information relevant to the issues discussed in this note can be found in the following documents: “Progress report on the development of a technology information system” (FCCC/SBSTA/2001/4) |  “Report of the technology information expert workshop |  Beijing |  China |  18–19 April 2002” (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.6) |  “Report of the expert meeting on methodologies for technology needs assessments |  Seoul |  Republic of Korea |  23–25 April 2002” (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.7) |  “Technology information system - submissions from Parties” (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.12) |  “Report of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) on its sixteenth session |  held at Bonn |  from 5–14 June 2002” (FCCC/2002/SBSTA/6 |  annex II1) |  and the “Annual report of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer” (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/9). C. Possible actions by the SBSTA |  |  |  | 4. |  |  |  | The SBSTA may wish to take note of the information in this document and |  where necessary: |  |  |  | (a) Provide further guidance to the secretariat with regard to its work on a technology information system |  in particular on the establishment of an international information clearing house including a network of technology information centres with a view to recommend to the COP a draft decision on this subject; (b) Urge those Parties included in Annex II to the Convention (Annex II Parties) that have not provided technical and financial assistance |  as appropriate |  to support the implementation of programmes and activities identified in the technology framework (decision 4/CP.7) and of the programme of work for the biennium 2002–2003 of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer |  to do so. |  |  |  | 1 |  |  |  | Appendix II |  Expert Group on Technology Transfer |  programme of work |  2002–2003. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2002/10 English Page 4 II. TECHNOLOGY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS A. Specific mandate 5. The Conference of Parties |  by its decision 4/CP.4 |  urged Parties not included in Annex I of the Convention (non-Annex I Parties) |  in the light of their social and economic conditions |  to submit their prioritized technology needs |  especially those relating to key technologies to address climate change in particular sectors of their economies |  taking into account state-of-the-art environmentally sound technologies. Recognizing the limited resources of non-Annex I Parties |  the COP |  by its decision 2/CP.4 |  directed the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to provide funding to developing countries to identify and submit to the COP their prioritized technology needs. 6. Furthermore |  decision 4/CP.7 of the COP encouraged Parties |  particularly developing country Parties |  to undertake assessments of country-specific technology needs |  subject to the provision of resources |  as appropriate to country-specific circumstances |  from developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in Annex II (FCCC/CP/2001/13/Add.1 |  decision 4/CP.7 |  annex |  para. 5). 7. At its sixteenth session |  the SBSTA requested the secretariat to cooperate with the GEF |  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |  and other relevant organizations and initiatives such as the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI) |  in their planned activities to develop a simplified and user-friendly handbook on methodologies for technology needs assessments and to report on its findings to the SBSTA at its eighteenth session (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/6 |  para. 38 (f)). B. Background 8. At present |  only a small number of developing country Parties are able to identify their technology needs; other countries lack the necessary resources |  technical skills and methodologies. However |  efforts are under way by multilateral institutions and various multilateral and bilateral initiatives to assist developing countries in identifying their technology needs; these efforts served as rich sources of inputs in the development of methodologies for technology needs assessments. 9. To address this concern |  the COP |  in the annex |  paragraph 7 |  of decision 4/CP.7 |  requested the Chairman of the SBSTA to organize an expert meeting on methodologies for technology needs assessments. The expert meeting was held in Seoul |  Republic of Korea |  from 23 to 25 April 2002 (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.7). C. Discussion 10. The April 2002 expert meeting on methodologies for technology needs assessments drew useful inputs from the experts and the Parties on how to proceed with the development of the methodology. The key messages from the expert meeting were that methodologies for assessing technology needs already exist and have been effectively applied effectively |  but they need to be improved to address climate change concerns such as treatment of adaptation technologies |  and some countries will need help to use them. 11. The Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) |  at its first meeting |  elaborated the recommendations from the expert meeting on technology needs assessments and included this issue in its programme of work as contained in appendix II to document FCCC/SBSTA/2002/6. The SBSTA |  at is sixteenth session |  and the EGTT encouraged the UNDP |  the CTI and other international organizations and iniatives that are initiating activities relating to technology needs assessments to pursue these activities in collaboration with the secretariat. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2002/10 English Page 5 12. As requested by the SBSTA |  at its sixteenth session |  the secretariat is consulting the UNDP |  the CTI and other relevant international organizations and initiatives |  on progress of their planned activities relating to technology needs assessments. The UNDP |  through the assistance provided by the GEF |  and in consultation with the secretariat |  the EGTT |  the CTI and other international organizations and initiatives |  is developing a handbook on technology needs assessments |  the CTI together with UNEP and other partners will organize two regional training workshops on technology transfer |  one for Asia |  from 24 to 26 September 2002 in Beijing |  China |  and one for Africa |  from 14 to 16 October 2002 in Dakar |  Senegal. These two workshops will include sections on need assessments methods and technology information. Two other training workshops will be convened in Latin America and the Caribbean and in Eastern Europe in 2003 |  resources permitting. 13. Currently 60 countries are benefiting from GEF assistance |  through the UNDP enabling activities programme under the top-up fund |  to conduct technology needs assessments |  and so far |  25 countries have completed their assessments. It is expected that |  as methodologies and training opportunities became available |  more countries will be able to assess and prioritize their technology needs. D. Issues for consideration 14. Major concerns |  that have repeatedly been raised during the workshops |  are how the results of these technology needs assessments would be reported and in which format |  and how those identified technologies will be financed. The SBSTA may wish to begin to discuss these matters |  with a view to seeking advice from the EGTT for its further consideration |  at its subsequent sessions. III. TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEM A. Specific mandate 15. The technology framework requested the secretariat to build on the success of the current work on the technology information system |  including that undertaken by the secretariat |  in cooperation with the CTI and other relevant organizations |  inter alia |  to develop a new search engine on the Internet that will facilitate quick access to existing inventories of environmentally sound and economically viable technologies and know-how |  including those conducive to mitigating and adapting to climate change. 16. At its fifteenth session |  the SBSTA requested the secretariat to continue its work on the technology information system |  drawing on links between its work and the work of existing institutions and networks |  in particular |  on information relating to adaptation technologies; and to explore the feasibility of including information on privately and publicly owned technologies and on joint research and development programmes |  and examples of success stories and case studies on technology transfer (FCCC/SBSTA/2001/8 |  para. 33 (d)). 17. At its sixteenth session |  the SBSTA requested the secretariat to initiate an outreach programme with the objective of making the technology information system developed by the secretariat available to the public and making the system more widely known to potential interested users |  including private sector and practitioners |  and to update the information and maintain the existing technology system (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/6 |  para. 38 (f) (i and ii)). B. Background 18. Following a request by the COP |  in its decision 4/CP.7 (FCCC/CP/2001/13/Add.1 |  decision 4/CP.7 |  annex |  para. 10 (c)) |  the secretariat organized an expert workshop on technology information to review the feedback from Parties on testing the technology information system (TT:CLEAR) |  and further define user needs for information |  criteria for information quality control |  technical specifications of the |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2002/10 English Page 6 system and contributions of Parties. The workshop was held in Beijing |  China |  from 18 to 19 April 2002. The report of the workshop is contained in document FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.6 and submissions from Parties on TT:CLEAR are contained in document FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.12. 19. The secretariat’s technology information system came on-line in September 2001. By 1 August 2002 |  some 260 users had registered with the system. The number of users per country is lower for developing countries than for Annex II countries. Users include experts in ministries |  research institutions and private industry |  media representatives and students. C. Discussion |  |  |  | 20. Since the last progress report was presented to the SBSTA at its fifteenth session |  the secretariat has undertaken the following activities in response to the above mandate on the technology information system: |  | (a) Updating the inventory of technology cooperation projects. This activity included updating relevant AIJ projects and adding projects cited in third national communications of Annex I Parties and initial national communications of non-Annex I Parties. At present some 1 | 650 projects are stored in the database (more than 450 projects have been added since COP 7); (b) Adding some success stories and case studies on technology transfer and making them available through the search engine. Various sources of information were used |  including the IPCC Special Report “Methodological and technological issues in technology transfer” |  the CTI publication “Technologies without borders; case studies of successful technology transfer” |  the GEF project performance reports and publications on experience and lessons learned |  and the UNEP publication “Two challenges |  one solution: case studies of technologies”; (c) Revising the structure of the projects database to follow the international development markup language (IDML) and the common exchange format for development activities (CEFDA) standard proposals on economic sectors classification and the types of assistance (grant |  load |  credit |  equity investment |  donation |  other |  and multiple) |  and updating relevant web pages; (d) Modifying TT:CLEAR search engine interfaces to access information from the redesigned CADDET energy efficiency and renewable energy and GREENTIE web sites. Interfaces for other sites (such as UNEP-maESTro and Google) are under development; (e) Further developing the classification of adaptation technologies |  designing and establishing the adaptation technology database |  modifying relevant web pages and populating the database with some mitigation technologies and some coastal adaptation technologies from technical paper “Coastal adaptation technologies” (FCCC/TP/1999/1). Reviewing and updating the database of mitigation technologies |  and identifying information gaps and potential sources of information and/or cooperative mechanisms for completing these databases; (f) Developing an electronic form and support databases to facilitate on-line reporting and updating of information on existing methods |  models |  and tools that have been used for assessing different technological options conducive to mitigating and adapting to climate change; (g) Preparing short write-ups for 14 mitigation methods |  models and tools and adding to the database the write-ups for 32 methods |  models |  and tools covering different aspects of adaptation to climate change |  presently available on the UNFCCC web site. The methods |  models and tools were made available through the search engine and can be searched by type (such as mitigation |  adaptation) and sector (such as energy |  transport |  forestry |  agriculture |  industry); |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2002/10 English Page 7 (h) Analysing options to exchange information between centres for technology transfer and developing a prototype for searching information on technology cooperation projects based on a peer-to-peer ad hoc network of centres and other relevant information providers and consumers; (i) Testing the feasibility of localization and transfer of the technology information software to national/regional centres. Key software components were translated into Chinese |  the software was transferred to a national centre and one expert from China was trained to install and configure the software. This demonstrates that the software can be translated to other UN languages |  resource permitting |  and that it can be used by centres to establish their own technology information system; (j) Revising the structure of the links database |  enhancing the search mechanism and updating the relevant web pages. Adding links to national web sites as provided by Parties in their submissions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.12) and providing “Quick links” to these sites. Adding more than 100 relevant web-site links submitted by Germany from the GATE project (at present |  about 600 links are stored in this database); (k) Considering comments and recommendations received from Parties and other users and making modifications to the system |  as appropriate; (l) the system; Adding web pages on technology needs assessments |  the EGTT |  and guidance for using |  |  |  | (m) Presenting TT:CLEAR at the technology workshops held in Asia in April 2002 |  adding a link to the system on the secretariat’s home page and preparing several outreach materials |  including a panel on development and transfer of technology and technology information for the UNFCCC kiosk to be presented at the WSSD and COP 8 |  and a leaflet on the system; (n) Developing an initial outreach programme for TT:CLEAR. The activities may include preparing a CD-ROM to be distributed in countries lacking access to the Internet |  presenting the technology information system at relevant technology events and disseminating information on TT:CLEAR through national focal points. Following the request by the SBSTA at its sixteenth session |  the secretariat |  in implementing the outreach programme |  will present and field test the system during the regional training courses to be convened by CTI in China in September 2002 and in Senegal in October 2002; 21. The submissions from Parties as well as the testing of TT:CLEAR initiated at the fifteenth session of the SBSTA generated good feedback and recommendations for further improvement of the system. However |  the number of registered users was considered by Parties at SBSTA 16 as insufficient to draw conclusions about the usefulness of the system. Therefore |  the SBSTA endorsed the work programme of the EGTT for the year 2002–2003 which indicates that the group will work closely with the secretariat to conduct a client survey |  to prepare a working paper on users’ needs |  information gaps and to make recommendations for improvements and to assess the effectiveness of the use of TT:CLEAR. A report on the outcome of these activities will be provided to the SBSTA at its nineteenth session. D. Issues for consideration 22. Updating and maintenance of the technology information system is not included in the present programme budget of the secretariat. The EGTT estimates that these activities will cost about US$ 100 | 000 over two years (2002–2003). These activities would require support from the supplementary fund. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2002/10 English Page 8 IV. INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION CLEARING HOUSE AND NETWORK OF TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION CENTRES A. Specific mandate 23. The technology framework provides for an international information clearing house |  including a network of technology information centres |  to be established under the auspices of the secretariat by the time of the eighth session of the COP |  taking into consideration the conclusions of the SBSTA |  at its sixteenth session |  on the report of the expert workshop on technology information held in Beijing |  China from 18 to 19 April 2002 (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.6). B. Background 24. During the expert workshop on technology information in Beijing |  the participants also considered the establishment of an international information clearing house |  including a network of technology information centres. 25. At the workshop |  two options for the establishment of the international technology clearing house were considered: (i) a centralized clearing house established under one institution; (ii) a virtual clearing house established primarily by linking and enhancing existing systems |  including the secretariat technology information system (TT:CLEAR) and other relevant technology information systems |  clearing houses |  web sites and networks. The second option was recommended to the SBSTA |  for further consideration at its sixteenth session (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.6 |  para. 52). C. Discussion 26. The SBSTA |  at its sixteenth session |  was not able to conclude its consideration of this subject. As endorsed by the SBSTA |  the EGTT will work closely with the secretariat to consider the needs |  logistical implications and institutional arrangements associated with networking international technology clearing houses and networks of regional and national technology centres |  with a view to providing further recommendations to the SBSTA at its subsequent sessions. D. Issues for consideration 27. The SBSTA may wish to provide further guidance to the EGTT and the secretariat on their future work relating to the establishment of an international technology information clearing house |  including the time frame for such establishment. V. CONSULTATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS A. Specific mandate 28. By its decision 4/CP.7 |  the COP requested the secretariat to consult with relevant international organizations |  and solicit information on their capacities and abilities to support certain activities identified in the technology framework |  and to report on its findings to the SBSTA at its seventeenth session” (FCCC/CP/2001/13/Add.1 |  decision 4/CP.7 |  para. 5 (a)). 29. At its sixteenth session |  the SBSTA invited the Parties and relevant international organizations in a position to do so |  to provide support to the work of the EGTT as proposed in its work programme (FCCC/SBTSA/2002/6 |  para. 38 (d)). |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2002/10 English Page 9 B. Discussion 30. As mandated |  the secretariat has consulted a number of relevant international organizations to solicit information on their capacities and abilities to support certain activities identified in the technology framework. A summary of possible areas for future collaboration with these organizations is contained in the annex to this note.

OPENING OF THE SESSION (Agenda item 1) |  | 1. The sixth session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) was held at the Hotel Maritim |  Bonn |  from 28 July to 5 August 1997. 2. The Chairman of the SBSTA |  Mr. Tibor Faragó |  opened the session on 28 July 1997. He welcomed all delegates as well as observers from non-Parties |  United Nations bodies and organizations |  and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and wished the participants a successful session. 3. The Executive Secretary welcomed the participants |  in particular the new Parties to the Convention |  provided information on the preparation for the sessions |  and reviewed the planning for the third session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 3). He urged that each subsidiary body at that and the subsequent session should |  to the extent possible |  aim at producing draft decisions recommended by it for adoption by the COP without further discussion. He urged the SBSTA and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) to minimize requests for new documentation for their October sessions. 4. The Executive Secretary expressed concern at the pace of submission of national communications |  noting that only six Annex I Parties had met the deadline |  and that hitherto |  only half of the communications due |  had been received. Also |  two communications had been received from non-Annex I Parties. He recalled that communications were the basic commitment of all Parties and that their lack would inhibit the ability of the Parties to assess the need for future action to advance implementation and to strengthen the Convention. |  |  |  | II.

The SBSTA noted with concern that it continues to be difficult for the secretariat to organize reviews with complete expert review teams (ERTs). In order to have complete teams |  some experts |  both from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention and from Annex I Parties |  were invited by the secretariat to participate in more than one review in 2008. 61. The SBSTA reiterated its request to Parties to nominate experts to the roster of experts |  update the roster at least once a year and make efforts to ensure that invited experts are able to participate in reviews. In addition |  the SBSTA requested the secretariat to provide |  in the annual report on the technical review |  information to Parties on the number of experts in the roster of experts |  the number of experts who have passed the training examinations and the number of experts participating in the review process. 62. The SBSTA noted the importance of the training for inventory review experts |  recalled the training programme referred to in decision 12/CP.9 |  annex I |  and requested the secretariat to update this programme for the period up to 2014. The updated training programme should include training courses and seminars for new review experts and possible new training modules on |  for example |  the review of higher tier methods and models as well as activities relevant to the training needs of experienced inventory review experts. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to prepare |  for consideration at its thirtieth session |  a draft of the updated training programme. 63. The SBSTA noted the challenges of inventory reviews for some sectors given the national circumstances of some countries |  and for higher tier methodologies |  in particular during in-country reviews. It recalled the provision of decision 19/CP.8 on the composition of ERTs and requested the secretariat to take into account these challenges in its organization of the ERTs and |  as appropriate |  include additional experts in the specific sector |  subject to the availability of a sufficient number of review experts. The SBSTA also requested lead reviewers to discuss |  at their next meeting |  their experiences with the review of higher tier methodologies and options to assist in and improve the review of these methodologies. 64. The SBSTA noted the need to enhance consistency of the reviews |  underpinned by the reviewer’s understanding and appropriate and consistent application of the UNFCCC review guidelines and review tools. It acknowledged the contribution of the lead reviewers and the usefulness of the recommendations resulting from the meetings of lead reviewers in improving the consistency and overall quality of the reviews. The SBSTA requested the lead reviewers to explore ways of improving the consistency of the reviews based on the experience of and lessons learned by the ERTs |  Parties and the secretariat in the review process. The SBSTA also requested the secretariat to include the consideration of these matters as a permanent agenda item for the meetings of lead reviewers |  and further requested the secretariat to prepare the necessary materials to facilitate this discussion. 65. The SBSTA recalled decision 12/CP.9 and noted that lead reviewers may consult with other lead reviewers on complex matters and questions during an ongoing review. The secretariat should facilitate such consultations by identifying lead reviewers with relevant expertise. The Party under review should be informed of these additional consultations. Any such consultations should be reflected in the review report. 66. The SBSTA acknowledged that managing the reporting and review processes |  including the training of experts |  planning and conducting the reviews and organizing the lead reviewer meetings |  as well as the further development of the GHG information system |  including the CRF Reporter software |  is placing considerable demand on the secretariat and requires considerable resources. The SBSTA reiterated the urgent need to give priority to these fundamental activities and plan future related activities. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2008/13 Page 13 It invited Annex I Parties to consider supporting these fundamental activities by providing stable and sufficient funding and to strengthen the coordination capacity of the secretariat. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to prepare a note describing how the activities referred to above are planned and prioritized for 2010−2011 and identifying commensurate resource requirements |  for its consideration at its thirtieth session. Although further funding has recently been provided by Parties |  the SBSTA encouraged Annex I Parties in a position to do so to provide the necessary funding for the 2009 training programme. B.

The SBSTA took note of the oral report by the secretariat that the eighth synthesis report on activities implemented jointly under the pilot phase has not yet been prepared because no new information on projects has been submitted. 97. The SBSTA decided to recommend a draft decision59 on the continuation of activities implemented jointly under the pilot phase for adoption by the COP at its fourteenth session (for the text of the decision |  see FCCC/SBSTA/2008/L.19/Add.1). Cooperation with the Secretariat for the Vienna Convention and its Montreal Protocol 98. The SBSTA noted the decisions of the twentieth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer on environmentally sound management of banks of ozone-depleting substances and on convening an open-ended dialogue on high global-warming potential alternatives for ozone-depleting substances.60 99. The SBSTA took note of the workshops referred to in those decisions and encouraged the secretariat to attend these workshops. The SBSTA also took note of the encouragement to Parties to include their climate experts as participants in the workshop |  as referred to in decision XX/8 |  paragraph 4. |  |  |  | XII. Report on the session |  | (Agenda item 12) 100. At its 4th meeting |  on 10 December |  the SBSTA considered and adopted the draft report on its twenty-ninth session.61 At the same meeting |  on a proposal by the Chair |  the SBSTA authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the session |  with the assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Chair. |  |  |  | XIII. Closure of the session |  | 101. At its 4th meeting |  on 10 December |  the representative of the Executive Secretary shared with the SBSTA a preliminary evaluation of the administrative and budgetary implications of conclusions adopted. This follows decision 16/CP.9 |  paragraph 20 |  which requests the Executive Secretary to provide an indication of the administrative and budgetary implications of decisions if these cannot be met from existing resources within the core budget. 102. The SBSTA |  at its twenty-ninth session |  requested the secretariat to carry out a number of activities that have administrative and budgetary implications. The majority of this work can be covered by the core budget or by resources that have already been included in the secretariat’s initial estimated requirements under the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities for this biennium. However |  under agenda item 5 |   Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate action  |  the secretariat has been asked to prepare and make available for consideration at its thirtieth session a technical paper |  which presents an unanticipated cost of approximately USD 100 | 000. 103. At the same meeting |  the Chair thanked delegates |  the chairs of contact groups and convenors of informal consultations for their contributions. |  |  |  | 59 60 |  |  |  | For the text as adopted |  see document FCCC/CP/2008/7/Add.1 |  decision 7/CP.14.

This annex contains relevant information and advice on the scientific |  technical and socio-economic aspects of impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change emerging from the implementation of the first phase of the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change.1 It is noted that the implementation of the second phase of the Nairobi work programme takes into consideration the information contained in this annex |  where relevant.2 Methods and tools 2. Integrated assessments are viewed as a useful way to comprehensively assess social |  economic and environmental impacts of climate change |  accounting for the interaction between climate change and other processes. 3. The existence of numerous gaps and needs prevents methods and tools from being widely disseminated and applied. Gaps include lack of sufficient data |  capacity |  proper information and guidance on available methods and tools |  including the associated uncertainties and limitations. 4. The identified needs include: improved capacity for local and sectoral assessments; integrated assessments at the subnational and national levels; integration of bottom-up and top-down approaches; better quantification of the costs and benefits of adaptation; and user-specific guidance on the application of the many available methods and tools. 5. Means for enhancing the dissemination of methods and tools include establishing and strengthening existing user networks to share expertise and experiences in the application of methods and tools; and establishing mechanisms to enable the comparison of methods and tools. Data and observations 6. There is a general understanding that the major challenge with regard to data and observations is not necessarily establishing an observation network |  but rather maintaining it on a long-term and sustained basis after external funding ceases |  and sharing the resulting data. 7. Identified data needs |  particularly in developing countries |  include the need for support for data collection and recovery of historical data |  the need to improve the collection |  management and use of data at the regional level |  and the need for enhanced access to global |  regional and national data. 8. In terms of observations |  there is a need to improve systematic observation and monitoring systems in order to better understand the impacts of climate change |  including by expanding coverage and increasing density |  and for raising awareness among policymakers of the need for strengthened national meteorological and hydrological services. 9. Human capacity for analysing and generating data also needs to be built through training and education programmes |  including improving understanding of uncertainties associated with the use of data and models. |  | 1 2 |  |  |  | The information and advice is drawn from document FCCC/SBSTA/2008/12. The activities to be undertaken during the second phase of the Nairobi work programme are contained in document FCCC/SBSTA/2008/6 |  paragraphs 10–74. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2008/13 Page 19 10. Means for improving the capacity for collecting |  managing and using observational data include undertaking a comprehensive stocktaking of the climatic and non-climatic data holdings at the national level and |  based on this assessment |  developing integrated management and collection systems capable of providing the information required for adaptation. Climate modelling |  scenarios and downscaling 11. Advances have been made in the methods for downscaling |  model resolution |  the simulation of processes of importance for regional change and in expanding the set of available simulations. 12. Gaps remain with respect to spatial and temporal resolution and uncertainties of scenarios and model outputs. These gaps have put constraints on the development of regional/subregional climate scenarios aiming at supporting policy-relevant impact and vulnerability assessments. Capacity-building is needed to understand the context and limitations of climate model outputs given the variety of assumptions on which models are based. There is also a need for a dialogue between the climate science community and adaptation practitioners |  including policymakers |  with a view to determining requirements and parameters for modelling activities so that model outputs become more policy-relevant. 13. Means for enhancing the development of regional and subregional climate scenarios include promoting regional centres and networks to ensure smooth knowledge sharing and transfer |  collaboration on scenario development using various models |  and capacity-building at regional and national levels. 14. Efforts to quantify and reduce uncertainty within and across models should be continued in order to increase the accuracy of future projections and the representation and communication of uncertainties should be improved to ensure credibility of model outputs and climate data. Climate-related risks and extreme events 15. One of the lessons learned is that the disaster risk reduction approach to risk assessment should be taken |  as it focuses on the prediction and reduction of impacts. 16. Traditional knowledge can complement other scientific sources of knowledge. Greater integration and use of such knowledge is needed in the assessment and management of climate-related risks |  particularly through partnerships with grass-roots organizations. 17. Gaps remain relating to the assessment |  prediction and management of climate-related risks and impacts |  including uncertainties in the prediction of climate variability and extreme events and a lack of response systems for identified risks. Needs identified include better integration of disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change into national sustainable development policies and plans |  and better methods and tools to predict |  manage and reduce impacts. Another gap is the limited availability and accessibility of risk-sharing mechanisms |  such as insurance |  in the most vulnerable countries. 18. Means for enhancing the assessment and prediction of climate-related risks and impacts include better provision of data at the national |  regional and global levels |  and continuous access for users to relevant data archives and databases. Socio-economic information 19. Socio-economic information can highlight the different exposures to climate threats and the adaptive capacities of regions |  countries and communities. 20. Socio-economic information lags behind biophysical and meteorological information in terms of quality |  availability and accessibility. A major gap is the lack of spatially differentiated socio-economic information |  especially at the subnational scale. Even when socio-economic information is available |  its applicability for adaptation planning is limited. Data are often collected in inconsistent formats |  |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2008/13 Page 20 disseminated on aggregate scales |  dispersed in terms of their location |  and not available in formats usable for vulnerability and impact assessments and adaptation planning. Further efforts are needed to improve the integration of qualitative socio-economic information into assessments. 21. Means for integrating socio-economic information into impact and vulnerability assessments include developing an open dialogue between providers and users of information in order to tailor information to specific data needs |  developing guidance on the use of existing data and packaging the information so that it is of relevance to the decision-making processes |  and developing information on costs and benefits of adaptation options. Adaptation planning and practices 22. Lessons learned include: using current exposure to natural hazards and climate variability as an entry point for adaptation; using case studies and guidelines to engage stakeholders; and the importance of understanding |  valuating and incorporating indigenous and local knowledge and technologies. 23. Despite some advances many gaps and needs remain. For example |  there is a gap between adaptation assessment and planning |  on the one hand |  and implementation on the other. This is due to a number of constraints including lack of capacity |  data |  information and resources. Uncoordinated sectoral responses can be ineffective or even counterproductive because responses in one sector can increase the vulnerability of another sector and/or reduce the effectiveness of adaptation responses taken in that sector. Hence there is a need to adopt a cross-sectoral approach to adaptation as part of an overall sustainable development strategy. 24. Conceptual frameworks for adaptation could assist in identifying the range of available adaptation options while at the same time providing for flexibility and the redesign of options as more clarity emerges regarding the level of change or impacts to which different sectors and levels need to adapt. Research 25. Needs identified regarding understanding impacts and vulnerabilities include reducing uncertainty in the sensitivity of the climate system |  enhancing the connections between General Circulation Models and regional models to improve the performance of regional climate change models |  and enhancing the validation of climate models with observations of essential climate variables. 26. In terms of facilitating adaptation planning and implementation |  research needs include understanding and reducing economic |  technical |  social and institutional barriers to adaptation as well as better understanding of various adaptation options |  including through identifying and assessing costs |  benefits and potential trade-offs. Efforts also need to be made to develop adaptation scenarios for different greenhouse gas stabilization levels and assumptions. Technologies for adaptation 27. Technologies for adaptation include hard technologies |  such as drought-resistant crop varieties |  seawalls and irrigation technologies |  or soft technologies |  such as crop rotation patterns. Many technologies have both hard and soft characteristics |  and successful adaptation action would typically combine the two. 28. Traditional technologies and know-how are key to technologies for adaptation; they already exist and are suitable for many developing countries |  and they can potentially be improved by local communities. 29. Many gaps and needs remain which constrain the widespread application of technologies for adaptation. Needs include building adequate human |  technical and institutional capacity to diffuse and |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2008/13 Page 21 employ technologies; improving information and awareness-raising among all stakeholders |  including communities; and providing sufficient financial resources. Economic diversification 30. Concerns exist over the difficulty of undertaking economic diversification |  particularly in countries where national circumstances make alternative economic activities difficult. 31. Public participation is needed in all the processes that increase resilience of |  and decrease reliance on |  vulnerable sectors; in this regard the private sector plays a key role. 32. Gaps and needs include the need for improved tools for modelling and assessment of vulnerability to climate change impacts in the context of economic diversification. There is a lack of models that link predictions of physical impacts to input–output models in order to assess sectoral vulnerability |  although these are necessary for effective economic diversification. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2008/13 Page 22 Annex II |  |  |  | Methodological guidance by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice |  | 1.

OPENING OF THE SESSION (Agenda item 1) 1. The tenth session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) was held at the Hotel Maritim |  Bonn |  from 31 May to 11 June 1999. 2. At the 1st meeting |  on 31 May 1999 |  the Chairman of the SBSTA |  Mr. Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia) |  opened the session and welcomed all delegates and observers. The Chairman noted that this was the first session of the SBSTA since the adoption of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (decision 1/CP.4)1 by the Conference of the Parties at its fourth session (COP 4) |  six months earlier. He recalled that the Plan of Action had outlined a series of work programmes aimed both at renewing efforts to implement the Convention and at preparing for the effective future implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The goals set out in the Plan of Action were ambitious |  and Parties would need to work in a determined and focused manner to meet the challenges ahead. The Chairman highlighted the important role which would be played by the SBSTA in this endeavour |  by undertaking in-depth technical and methodological work. He expressed hope that the technical workshops and informal meetings which had taken place in the inter-sessional period would help advance deliberations at the tenth session. He urged all Parties to strive to demonstrate substantial progress on each element of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action in a spirit of constructive cooperation. The Chairman concluded by extending a special welcome to the officers of the SBSTA Bureau: Mr. Lambert Gnapelet (Central African Republic) |  Vice-Chairman |  and Mr. Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia) |  Rapporteur. 3. Also at the 1st meeting |  on 31 May |  a statement was made by the Executive Secretary |  addressed to both the SBSTA and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI). He apologized for the late availability in print of many documents prepared by the secretariat for the session |  and undertook to ensure more timely document preparation in the future. The delay had been partly due to the increased workload resulting from the organization of inter-sessional technical workshops mandated by COP 4. The Executive Secretary remarked that an opportunity to assess the role of workshops |  including their budgetary implications |  would arise in the context of discussions in the SBI on arrangements for intergovernmental meetings. Looking ahead |  the Executive Secretary highlighted what he saw as potential politically significant outcomes of COP 5 that would build momentum for success at COP 6 |  namely |  mobilizing support for capacity-building and taking decisions on the consideration of initial national communications from non-Annex I Parties and on the pilot phase of activities implemented jointly. |  |  |  | 1 |  |  |  | For the full texts of decisions adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its fourth session |  see document FCCC/CP/1998/16/Add.1. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1999/6 English Page 5 4. At the joint meeting of the SBSTA and the SBI |  held on 1 June |  general statements were made by representatives of five Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the African Group |  one speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States |  one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States and one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.

At its 10th meeting |  on 1 November |  having considered a proposal by the Chairman |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA took note of the information provided by the secretariat on the rosters of experts nominated by Parties and their use by the secretariat (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/9); (b) The SBSTA noted that the rosters of experts should respond to the evolving needs of the Convention bodies. In this regard |  it recognized that some areas of expertise are not included in the rosters |  but should be |  as the need arises; (c) The SBSTA concluded that the rosters should be integrated into one UNFCCC roster of experts to serve the various needs of the Convention. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to design a unified UNFCCC roster |  building upon the fields of expertise identified in document FCCC/SBSTA/1998/INF.4 |  annex I. In so doing |  the secretariat should prepare a revised application form and make it available to Parties on its web site and in hard copy by 15 February 2000; (d) The SBSTA invited Parties to update the information on their previous nominees based on the new application form prepared by the secretariat. Parties are also invited to nominate additional experts to the roster. To facilitate the submission of information |  the SBSTA requested the secretariat to make the necessary arrangements |  including the provision of an electronic password to national focal points |  to enable Parties to directly update the information on their nominees using the web site of the secretariat. Parties without Internet access are invited to update information to the secretariat by fax. Information to be made available to national focal points on the web will exclude contact information |  unless explicitly authorized by each expert. The public information will include the name |  nominating Party |  region |  current employer |  specific fields of expertise and the task for which the expert is nominated; |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1999/14 English Page 34 (e) The SBSTA requested the secretariat to report periodically on the status of nominations for the various tasks covered by the roster. These reports should inter alia inform Parties about existing deficiencies with regard to the area-specific expertise needed to carry out the assigned tasks; and (f) The SBSTA took special note of the needs of the technical review process for greenhouse gas inventories submitted by Annex I Parties to the Convention |  which will begin in 2000. It encouraged Parties to make additional nominations for this process |  using the revised nomination form to be provided by the secretariat |  as noted in subparagraph (c) above |  by 15 April 2000. Parties are urged to ensure that the persons nominated are well qualified and available to participate in these reviews. XIV. MATTERS RELATING TO ARTICLE 3.14 OF THE KYOTO PROTOCOL (Agenda item 14) 109. At its 1st meeting |  on 25 October |  the SBSTA agreed to consider this item in a coordinated manner with the SBI |  and in conjunction with its agenda item 3 |  “Implementation of Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention (decision 3/CP.3 and Articles 2.3 and 3.14 of the Kyoto Protocol)”. Conclusions on this item may therefore be found in paragraph 15 above. XV. REPORT ON THE SESSION (Agenda item 15) 110. At its 14th meeting |  on 3 November |  the SBSTA considered the draft report on its eleventh session (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/L.11). 111. At the same meeting |  on a proposal by the Chairman |  the SBSTA authorized the Rapporteur |  with the assistance of the secretariat |  to complete the report on the session |  under the guidance of the Chairman. XVI. CLOSURE OF THE SESSION 112. At the 14th meeting |  on 3 November |  the Chairman commended all participants for their constructive cooperation during the session. The Chairman remarked that |  although steady progress had been made |  much work remained to be done before COP 6. In this regard |  he pointed to the busy schedule of inter-sessional work ahead |  including a number of workshops. He noted that |  following the usual practice |  representatives of non-governmental organizations would be invited to attend such workshops as observers |  in a manner that promotes cooperation and coordination |  and which also ensures an appropriate balance among the constituencies. The Chairman concluded by expressing confidence that this inter-sessional work would provide a useful input to the twelfth sessions of the subsidiary bodies. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1999/14 English Page 35 Annex I BASIC ELEMENTS OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS UNDER ARTICLE 5.1 OF THE KYOTO PROTOCOL OBJECTIVE To enable Parties to estimate anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol |  as required by Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol. CHARACTERISTICS National systems should cover all institutional arrangements and procedures within a Party for inventory development |  allowing for flexible adaptation to national circumstances because of the existing differences in institutional structure and organization |  as well as in approaches to inventory development between Parties. FUNCTIONS National systems: • • • • • Ensure that the national inventory process |  including inventory planning |  development and management |  is in accordance with any decisions by the COP; Define and apply appropriate procedures for collecting |  processing |  communicating and storing inventory data; Provide for liaison between government departments |  national agencies and other entities responsible for inventories; Enable the provision of greenhouse gas inventory data annually; Ensure confidence in the quality of inventory data by implementing uncertainty assessment |  quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures including verification and/or auditing procedures of the inventory data at the national level; and Facilitate the technical review process to be agreed upon by the COP serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol under Article 8 of that Protocol. |  |  |  | • |  |  |  | REQUIRED ELEMENTS OF NATIONAL SYSTEMS The national systems should be robust enough to support compliance with the Protocol and therefore common elements need to be defined. These should or could include: |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1999/14 English Page 36 Institutional arrangements: • • • • A single national entity responsible for the overall inventory; Collaborating entities which contribute to the preparation and/or management of the inventory; Arrangements for technical competence and its evolution; and Authority to ensure collection and dissemination of all necessary data for the preparation of the inventory. |  |  |  | Inventory processes: • • Inventory planning: a documented plan for the development |  preparation and management of inventories |  including a plan for QA/QC procedures; Inventory development: identification of greenhouse gas sources including the significance of the sources; procedures for choice of methodology and emission factors |  activity data collection |  management of uncertainties; Inventory preparation: data collection (frequency |  procedures) |  estimation of procedures (good practice) |  documentation of data sources and methodologies; QA/QC procedures; and Inventory management: archiving of all data |  inventory estimates and documentation; transfer and compilation of data (frequency |  electronic transfer and data management). |  |  |  | • |  |  |  | • |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1999/14 English Page 37 Annex II LIST OF DOCUMENTS BEFORE THE SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE AT ITS ELEVENTH SESSION Documents prepared for the session |  |  |  | FCCC/CP/1999/1 |  |  |  | Provisional agendas for the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies.

OPENING OF THE SESSION (Agenda item 1) 1. The second session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (hereinafter referred to as  the SBSTA ) was held at Geneva from 27 February to 4 March 1996. 2. The Chairman of the SBSTA |  Mr. Tibor Faragó |  opened the session at the 1st meeting |  on 27 February 1996. He welcomed all participants. He referred to the heavy agenda for the session and the need to coordinate the work of the session with that of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM) |  which would also be meeting. He was confident that the work of the session could be completed successfully in a cooperative and timely manner. 3. The Executive Secretary made an introductory statement in which he provided information on the status of ratification of the Convention and of the documentation for the session. He suggested that |  while the secretariat should improve its delivery of documentation |  subsidiary bodies might evaluate more carefully the utility of new documents before requesting them of the secretariat. He also stressed the need for the current session of subsidiary bodies to pay attention to the inputs that will be required of them by the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its second session. He asked that this statement be taken into account by the SBI and the AGBM at their forthcoming sessions. |  |  |  | II. ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS (Agenda item 2) A. Adoption of the agenda (Agenda item 2 (a)) 4. At its 1st meeting |  on 27 February |  the SBSTA adopted the following agenda: 1. 2. Opening of the session. Organizational matters: (a) (b) 3.

On the subject of applications for accreditation to sessions of the subsidiary bodies of the Convention |  the SBSTA agreed to admit new applicant organizations that had been screened by the secretariat |  on the basis of the provisions of Article 7.6 of the Convention |  without prejudice to subsequent action by the COP. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 6 |  |  |  | 7. Further |  in accordance with the recommendation of the Bureau of the COP |  the SBSTA agreed to maintain its policy that non-governmental organizations would be admitted to the floor before and after meetings only. In relation to this |  the Chairman indicated his readiness to explore the possibilities for flexibility on this policy and expressed his willingness to discuss the matter |  as necessary |  with the non-governmental organizations concerned. As a consequence |  a provisional arrangement was agreed where representatives of three non-governmental organizations were admitted to the floor during the 6th meeting |  on 4 March. C. Attendance 8. The lists of attendance at the second session of the SBSTA are given in annex I. D. Documentation 9. The documents before the SBSTA at its second session are listed in annex II. |  |  |  | III. ESTABLISHMENT OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL TECHNICAL ADVISORY PANEL(S) (Agenda item 3) 1. Proceedings 10. At its 1st |  3rd |  4th and 6th meetings |  on 27 |  28 and 29 February |  and 4 March |  respectively |  the SBSTA addressed the item on the establishment of intergovernmental technical advisory panel(s). It had before it a note by the Chairman on his informal consultations on this matter (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/2). 11. Statements were made by the representatives of eight Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States |  and another speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. 12. At the 6th meeting |  on 4 March |  the representative of the Philippines |  speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China |  expressed her great disappointment that the process for the establishment of the intergovernmental technical advisory panel(s) had not been agreed. She suggested the setting up of a roster of experts and requested that her statement on this item be reflected in the report of the session. The statement is reproduced in document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/MISC.3. 13. A representative of one State |  not party to the Convention |  also made a statement. |  |  |  | 14. The positions of the Group of 77 and China and of the United States of America are reproduced in document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/MISC.3 |  for future reference. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 7 |  |  |  | 2. Conclusions 15. On the basis of proposals by the Chairman |  the SBSTA |  at its 6th meeting |  on 4 March |  adopted the following conclusions. 16. The SBSTA recognized that the intergovernmental technical advisory panel(s) had the potential to make an important contribution to the processes under the Convention and to the implementation of the Convention by Parties |  in particular by providing an opportunity to draw upon the broad range of expertise available in Parties. However |  at this stage the SBSTA could not agree on the modalities for such a panel |  or panels |  and decided to request guidance from the next session of the COP on this issue; in this context |  it requested its Chairman to report to the COP. 17. The SBSTA also recognized that it may be beneficial to develop a roster of experts to assist the Convention process in the conduct of its work. It requested the Parties to submit comments on the concept of a roster |  including the disciplines that such a roster might cover |  by 1 April 1996. It requested the secretariat to prepare a compilation of the comments as well as a paper on this subject. |  |  |  | IV. SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENTS (Agenda item 4) A. Consideration of the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Agenda item 4 (a)) 1. Proceedings |  |  |  | 18. At its 2nd |  3rd |  4th |  5th and 6th meetings on 27 |  28 and 29 February |  and 1 and 4 March |  respectively |  the SBSTA considered this item on the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC. It had before it a note prepared by the secretariat |  document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/7 and Adds. 1 |  2 and 3. 19. The Chairman of the IPCC introduced the Second Assessment Report. |  |  |  | 20. Statements were made by the representatives of 25 Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States |  another speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) |  and another speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. 21. A representative of one State |  not party to the Convention |  made a statement. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 8 |  |  |  | 22. The representative of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) made a statement. 23. A representative of the Climate Action Network also made a statement. |  |  |  | 24. Some delegations drew attention to a number of important findings in the Second Assessment Report which they felt should be communicated to all bodies of the Convention and particularly to the AGBM |  for consideration. These delegations highlighted that these findings underlined the necessity for urgent action to address adverse effects of climate change |  including mitigation and adaptation: (a) Atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols are increasing largely because of human activities (IPCC Synthesis Report (SR) |  (section) 2.2 |  2.3); (b) Climate has changed over the past century (SR 2.4); |  |  |  | (c) The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate (SR 2.4); (d) Without specific policies to mitigate climate change |  the global mean surface air temperature relative to 1990 is projected to increase by about 2˚C (between 1.0˚ and 3.5˚C) by 2100. This is probably greater than any observed during the last 10 | 000 years (SR 2.8); (e) Average sealevel is projected to rise by about 50 centimetres (between 15 and 95 centimetres) above present levels by 2100 (SR 2.8); (f) Stabilization of atmospheric concentrations at twice pre-industrial levels will eventually require global emissions to be less than 50 percent of current levels (SR 4.10); (g) Even if the concentrations of greenhouse gases were stabilized at 2100 |  global mean surface air temperature would continue to rise for some decades |  and sealevel for many centuries beyond that time (SR 2.7 |  2.8); (h) The projected changes in climate change will result in significant |  often adverse impacts on many ecological systems and socio-economic sectors |  including food supply and water resources |  and on human health. In some cases |  the impacts are potentially irreversible (SR 3.2 |  3.3); (i) Developing countries and small island countries are typically more vulnerable to climate change (SR 3.3); |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 9 |  |  |  | (j) Significant reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions are technically possible and economically feasible by utilizing an extensive array of technology and policy measures that accelerate technology development |  diffusion and transfer (SR 5.2); (k) Significant no regrets opportunities are available in most countries to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore |  the risk of aggregate net damage due to climate change |  consideration of risk aversion |  and the precautionary principle provide rationales for action beyond no regrets (SR 8.2); (l) A portfolio of existing cost-effective technologies |  policies and measures can be used to markedly reduce the net emissions of greenhouse gases from all sectors (SR 5.5 |  5.6 |  5.11 |  5.12 |  8.4); (m) Flexible |  cost-effective policies relying on economic incentives and instruments |  as well as coordinated instruments |  can considerably reduce mitigation and adaptation costs |  or can increase the cost-effectiveness of emission reduction measures (SR 8.3); (n) Equity considerations are an important aspect of climate change policy and in achieving sustainable development. The intertemporal aspects of climate change policy also raise questions of intergenerational equity (SR 6.1 |  6.5); (o) Uncertainties remain and there is a need for further work to reduce these uncertainties. 25. Other delegations expressed their view that it is very premature for the SBSTA to attempt to highlight specific findings of conclusions contained in the Second Assessment Report. They stated their belief that the list of items identified by certain delegations was highly selective and reflected a very limited |  and |  therefore |  biased view of what were important findings in the Second Assessment Report. They also pointed out that some of the items listed by others were taken out of context and failed to set forth important qualifications that the IPCC specifically stated. 26. These delegations suggested that a preliminary review of the IPCC’s Synthesis Report indicated that other important IPCC findings included |  inter alia: (a) Item 24 (c) above is merely quoted selectively concerning the IPCC’s conclusions that the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate. It fails to disclose the key IPCC finding that its ability to quantify the human influence is limited  because there are uncertainties in key factors.  It fails to disclose that one of these uncertainties in key factors concerns the magnitude and patterns of long-term natural variability. This information is clearly set forth in the Working Group I Summary for Policymakers |  page 4 and in the IPCC Synthesis Report |  paragraph 2.4; |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 10 |  |  |  | (b) Item 24 (d) above fails to disclose that the estimated temperature increase of 2oC by 2100 is approximately 1/3 lower than the IPCC’s  best estimate  in 1990. That information is contained in paragraph 2.7 of the Synthesis Report and on page 5 of the Working Group I Summary for Policymakers; (c) Item 24 (e) above fails to disclose the important information that the estimate of sealevel rise by 2100 is 25 per cent lower than the IPCC’s  best estimate  in 1990. That information is found in paragraph 2.8 of the Synthesis Report and on page 5 of the Working Group I Summary for Policymakers. (d) Much attention has been paid to the issues of so-called extreme events. Unfortunately |  the items in paragraph 24 above fail to disclose the very important conclusion that  there are inadequate data to determine whether consistent global changes in climate variability or weather extremes have occurred over the 20th century.  Such information is contained in paragraph 2.5 of the Synthesis Report and on page 3 of the Working Group I Summary for Policymakers; (e) Clearly |  a key finding of the IPCC Synthesis Report |  found in paragraph 2.12 |  is that  many uncertainties and many factors currently limit our ability to project and detect future climate change ; (f) Insofar as item 24 (h) above purports to deal with impacts on food supply |  it is seriously misleading because it fails to disclose the key information in paragraph 3.13 of the Synthesis Report and section 3.3 of the IPCC Working Group II Summary for Policymakers that  existing studies show that on the whole |  global agricultural production could be maintained relative to baseline production in the face of climate change projected under doubled equivalent CO2 equilibrium conditions ; (g) Insofar as the list of items above concern response strategies and call for urgent action |  it should be recalled that IPCC Working Group III specifically concluded that  the value of better information about climate change processes and impacts and society’s responses to them is likely to be great |   and that paragraph 8.4 of the Synthesis Report called attention to  large differences in the cost of reducing greenhouse gas emissions |  and enhancing sinks |  among countries due to their state of economic development |  infrastructure choices |  and natural resources base.  2. Conclusions 27. On the basis of proposals by the Chairman |  the SBSTA |  at its 6th meeting |  on 4 March |  adopted the following conclusions. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 11 |  |  |  | 28. The SBSTA expressed its appreciation to the IPCC and to the Chairman of the IPCC for the excellent work carried out in drawing up the Second Assessment Report and for the Chairman’s presentation to the SBSTA on 27 February of the key points of the report. It considered the Second Assessment Report to be the most comprehensive assessment of available scientific and technical information related to climate change. 29. The SBSTA held an initial exchange of views on the Second Assessment Report during its meetings. It commended the entire Second Assessment Report to all bodies of the Convention and particularly to the AGBM. The SBSTA invited Parties to send their views on the report in order to facilitate full consideration of it at the third session |  in keeping with its mandate as contained in COP decision 6/CP.1* |  annex I |  paragraph 1 and annex II |  paragraph 1. The views of the Parties should be transmitted to the secretariat by 30 April 1996. 30. The SBSTA decided to include in its future work programme the key questions deriving from Article 2 of the Convention |  namely the level of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system and the paths to stabilization at that level |  taking into account the common but differentiated responsibilities of Parties. In this context |  the IPCC Second Assessment synthesis of scientific-technical information relevant to interpreting Article 2 of the Convention was considered as an important scientifically-based |  comprehensive analysis. It also recognized that the IPCC would have to provide further technical inputs that would enable the SBSTA and the COP to address the ultimate objective of the Convention. 31. The SBSTA also agreed that the findings and projections of the Second Assessment Report should be made available in a suitable form to different audiences with special attention being given to the impacts and circumstances at the national and regional levels. It invited Parties |  organizations and institutions to give appropriate attention to this need. 32. The SBSTA took note of the information provided by the WMO and a number of Parties |  relevant to the implementation of Article 5 of the Convention |  on Research and Systematic Observation. It requested the secretariat to prepare a summary report on research and observation issues |  with attention to Article 5 |  and particularly to Article 5 (c) |  of the Convention |  in close collaboration with Parties and concerned international organizations |  and taking into account the recommendations of the Second Assessment Report |  for consideration by the third session of the SBSTA and subsequently by the COP. |  |  |  | * For decisions adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its first session |  see document FCCC/CP/1995/7/Add.1. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 12 |  |  |  | B. |  |  |  | Cooperation with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Agenda item 4 (b)) 1. Proceedings |  |  |  | 33. At its 3rd |  4th |  5th and 6th meetings on 28 and 29 February |  and 1 and 4 March |  respectively |  the SBSTA addressed the item on cooperation with the IPCC. It had before it a note prepared by the secretariat |  document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/6. 34. Statements were made by the representatives of 18 Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States |  another speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States |  and another speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. 35. A representative of one State |  not party to the Convention |  made a statement. |  |  |  | 36. The representatives of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the United Nations Educational |  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO/IOC) |  and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also made statements. 2. Conclusions 37. On the basis of proposals by the Chairman |  the SBSTA |  at its 6th meeting |  on 4 March |  adopted the following conclusions. 38. The SBSTA noted with appreciation the decisions taken by the IPCC at its eleventh session in Rome (December 1995) on its future work programme |  and |  particularly |  that it intends to prepare a Third Assessment Report by around 2000 and continue to work on methodologies for greenhouse gas inventory. 39. The SBSTA considered the conclusions of the meetings of the Joint Working Group of officers of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the IPCC. Taking into account also the statements made during the session |  it requested the IPCC to undertake the proposed activities in support of the SBSTA contained in annex III to this report |  and advise the SBSTA accordingly. 40. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to take the above-mentioned activities as the basis for proposing a financial contribution to the IPCC in 1996 |  as provided in the Convention budget and to report thereon to the third session of the SBI and the second session of the COP. 41. The SBSTA appreciated that in addition to the proposed activities contained in annex III to this report |  the IPCC was providing enhanced scientific and technical information to the evolving needs of the AGBM. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 13 |  |  |  | 42. The SBSTA noted that |  for several issues identified in the annex to document FCCC/SBSTA/1995/3 |  some information is available in the IPCC Special Report 1994 and the Second Assessment Report |  and would be expected to be included in the Third Assessment Report. These issues are: (a) Developing and/or assessing: (i) (ii) (iii) (b) (c) Methodologies for projecting national |  regional and global emissions; Methodologies for evaluating the effects of measures; and The application of global warming potentials; |  |  |  | Information on sources and sinks; Reducing uncertainties related to particulate matter and tropospheric ozone. |  |  |  | 43. The SBSTA noted further that |  in addition to its sponsoring bodies WMO and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) |  the IPCC was cooperating with other relevant competent international organizations in responding to the need for objective scientific and technical advice |  and it emphasized the importance of such cooperation. 44. Finally |  the SBSTA requested its Chairman to continue the series of meetings of the Joint Working Group of officers of the UNFCCC and the IPCC |  as and when appropriate |  and to report on these meetings to future sessions of the SBSTA. |  |  |  | V. |  |  |  | NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS (Agenda item 5) |  |  |  | A. Communications from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Agenda item 5 (a)) (i) Progress report on in-depth reviews 1. Proceedings 45. At its 3rd |  4th and 6th meetings on 28 and 29 February |  and 4 March |  respectively |  the SBSTA addressed the item on progress report on in-depth reviews. It had before it a note prepared by the secretariat |  document FCCC/SB/1996/2. 46. Statements were made by the representatives of nine Parties including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States |  and another speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 14 |  |  |  | 2. Conclusions 47. On the basis of proposals by the Chairman |  the SBSTA |  at its 6th meeting |  on 4 March |  adopted the following conclusions. 48. The SBSTA took note of the progress report on in-depth reviews (FCCC/SB/1996/2) and of the in-depth review reports issued so far (FCCC/IDR.1/CZE |  FCCC/IDR.1/SWE |  FCCC/IDR.1/AUS |  FCCC/IDR.1/USA |  FCCC/IDR.1/CAN |  FCCC/IDR.1/CHE). The SBSTA endorsed the format |  scope and approaches of the in-depth review reports and emphasized the importance of monitoring the overall implementation of the Convention. The SBSTA took note with regret that the time schedule for these reviews as set by the first session of the COP could not be met owing to resource limitations and/or scheduling problems. It stressed the importance of completing the first cycle of in-depth reviews by the end of 1996 and of issuing as many reports as possible before the next sessions of subsidiary bodies |  with a view to holding a substantive discussion at those sessions. (ii) Elements of the second compilation and synthesis report 1. Proceedings 49. At its 3rd |  4th and 6th meetings on 28 and 29 February |  and 4 March |  respectively |  the SBSTA considered the item on elements of the second compilation and synthesis report. It had before it a note prepared by the secretariat |  document FCCC/SB/1996/1. 50. Statements were made by the representatives of 11 Parties. 2. Conclusions 51. On the basis of proposals by the Chairman |  the SBSTA |  at its 6th meeting |  on 4 March |  adopted the following conclusions. 52. The SBSTA endorsed the proposed outline and approaches to be taken during the second compilation and synthesis of first national communications |  as suggested by the secretariat in its document FCCC/SB/1996/1. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to explore ways to use tables in the compilation of policies and measures and to describe national circumstances |  inter alia |  national policy targets. 53. The SBSTA took note of preliminary data presented in document FCCC/SB/1996/1/Add.1 on projections of emissions of greenhouse gases for the year 2000 which indicate that many Annex I Parties will have to make additional efforts beyond those included in the projections in order to return greenhouse gas emissions to base year levels by 2000. The SBSTA stressed the need for more transparency in the assumptions made in these projections. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 15 |  |  |  | 54. The SBSTA recalled decision 3/CP.1 requesting Annex I Parties to submit to the secretariat national inventory data for the period 1990-1993 and |  where available |  for 1994 by 15 April 1996 |  and encouraged these Parties to submit these data at an earlier date to facilitate preparation of the second compilation and synthesis report. It recognized that |  based on Article 4.6 of the Convention regarding these submissions |  Annex I Parties with economies in transition may exercise a certain degree of flexibility. 55. The SBSTA invited Annex I Parties to forward to the secretariat their suggestions related to the presentation of inventory data on the land use change and forestry sector for years subsequent to 1990 and on projections in this sector |  as well as on aggregating data on greenhouse gases sources and sinks from this and other sectors |  by 1 April 1996. 56. The SBSTA will consider technical aspects of available in-depth review reports and of the second compilation and synthesis report at its third session in order to draw relevant conclusions to the attention of the SBI at its third session and the AGBM at its fourth session |  as well as to the COP at its second session. (iii) Report on guidelines for the preparation of communications 1. Proceedings 57. At its 3rd |  4th and 6th meetings on 28 and 29 February and 4 March |  respectively |  the SBSTA addressed the item on the report on guidelines for the preparation of communications. It had before it a note prepared by the secretariat |  document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/3. 58. Statements were made by the representatives of nine Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. 2. Conclusions 59. On the basis of the proposals by the Chairman |  the SBSTA |  at its 6th meeting |  on 4 March |  adopted the following conclusions. 60. The SBSTA took note of document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/3 and endorsed the proposals regarding the revisions to the guidelines to ensure consistency with COP decisions. The SBSTA requested that revised guidelines contain more specific guidance on the description of policies and measures and their effects |  projections and underlying assumptions and technological cooperation and transfer using |  where feasible |  standardized formats and tables. The revised guidelines should also take into account the issues referred to by the SBI in its conclusions on the transfer of technology. The SBSTA invited Parties to submit views on possible revisions to the guidelines |  as suggested in document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/3 |  by 1 April 1996. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 16 |  |  |  | 61. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to prepare a report suggesting possible revisions to the guidelines |  taking into account the submissions by Parties and the experience from the review process |  for consideration at its third session |  aiming at adopting revised guidelines at COP 2 in time for the preparation of the second national communications by Annex I Parties. 62. The SBSTA |  with a view to overcoming inconsistencies in the presentation of data on inventories |  requested the secretariat to address issues such as temperature adjustments |  electricity trade |  bunker fuels |  use of global warming potentials |  land use change |  and forestry in the documentation to be prepared for consideration by the SBSTA at its third session. B. Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (Agenda item 5 (b)) 1. Proceedings 63. At its 4th and 6th meetings on 29 February and 4 March |  respectively |  the SBSTA considered the item on communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention. It had before it a note prepared by the secretariat |  document FCCC/SB/1996/3. 64. Statements were made by the representatives of four Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China |  another speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States |  and another speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States. 2. Conclusions 65. On the basis of proposals by the Chairman |  the SBSTA |  at its 6th meeting |  on 4 March |  adopted the following conclusions. 66. The SBSTA recalled decision 8/CP.1 and took note of document FCCC/SB/1996/3. |  |  |  | 67. It noted with appreciation document FCCC/SB/1996/MISC.1/Add.1 containing the position paper of the Group of 77 and China on recommendations on guidelines and format for the preparation of initial communications from non-Annex I Parties |  which was developed on the basis of the workshop held on 26 February 1996. 68. The SBSTA considered document FCCC/SB/MISC.1/Add.1 as the principal basis for the adoption of guidelines and format for the preparation of initial communications from non-Annex I Parties. It agreed to continue consideration of the item at its third session. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 17 |  |  |  | VI. ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY UNDER THE PILOT PHASE (Agenda item 6) 1. Proceedings 69. At its 3rd |  4th and 6th meetings on 28 and 29 February and 4 March |  respectively |  the SBSTA addressed the item on activities implemented jointly under the pilot phase. It had before it a note prepared by the secretariat |  document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/5. 70. Statements were made by the representatives of five Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. 2. Conclusions 71. On the basis of proposals by the Chairman |  the SBSTA |  at its 6th meeting |  on 4 March |  adopted the following conclusions. 72. The SBSTA recalled decision 5/CP.1 establishing a pilot phase for activities implemented jointly and setting criteria for it |  inter alia |  that no credits shall accrue to any Party as a result of greenhouse gas emissions reduced or sequestered during the pilot phase from activities implemented jointly |  and in particular the mandate given to the SBSTA |  in coordination with SBI |  to establish a framework for reporting activities implemented jointly under the pilot phase. 73. The SBSTA decided to adopt the initial framework for reporting activities implemented jointly as presented in annex IV to this report. 74. The SBSTA invited Parties to identify the relevant governmental authority/ministry authorized to accept |  approve or endorse activities implemented jointly and to report them to the COP through the secretariat. 75. The SBSTA also invited Parties to submit reports in accordance with the initial framework for reporting activities implemented jointly given in annex IV. 76. The SBSTA also decided to compile and synthesize |  in cooperation with the SBI |  and with the assistance of the secretariat |  information transmitted by the Parties in the form of a report which shall be considered annually by the COP |  and based on this information |  to develop suggestions for improving the initial reporting framework and for addressing methodological issues |  as necessary. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 18 |  |  |  | VII. TECHNOLOGY INVENTORY AND ASSESSMENT (Agenda item 7) 1. Proceedings 77. At its 5th and 6th meetings on 1 and 4 March |  respectively |  the SBSTA addressed the item on technology inventory and assessment. It had before it a note prepared by the secretariat |  document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/4 and Add.1. 78. Statements were made by the representatives of 12 Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. 79. The representative of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) also made a statement. 2. Conclusions 80. On the basis of proposals by the Chairman |  the SBSTA |  at its 6th meeting |  on 4 March |  adopted the following conclusions. 81. The SBSTA considered the preparation of a technology inventory and assessment |  as mentioned in decision 13/CP.1 and based its discussions on the initial report of the secretariat on this subject (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/4). It recalled the division of labour between the SBSTA and the SBI regarding technology issues as indicated in decision 6/CP.1 on the subsidiary bodies established by the Convention. It noted the statements regarding the Climate Technology Initiative and the statement made by the representative of UNIDO concerning a study of industrial technologies. 82. The SBSTA recognized that the identification of and information on technologies and know-how that could assist the Parties in the preparation of national plans would be particularly useful |  and urged all Parties who have not already done so to provide the secretariat with information and databases on environmentally sound and economically viable technologies and know-how conducive to mitigating and adapting to climate change |  including information from the private sector when possible |  and to continue to do so on a routine basis in the future. 83. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to continue its activities |  in cooperation with other relevant organizations |  related to the preparation of an inventory and assessment of environmentally sound and economically viable technologies and know-how conducive to mitigating and adapting to climate change |  to take into consideration the activities of other United Nations agencies and intergovernmental organizations |  and other relevant programmes and to use all means possible to communicate the information to Parties. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 19 |  |  |  | 84. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to identify existing sources of |  as well as gaps in |  information concerning technology information centres |  with a view to developing a plan for setting up specialized technology information centres that could include |  inter alia |  sources of financing |  preparation of comprehensive catalogues |  dissemination of information and assessment of suitable technology. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to conduct a survey in order to identify the needs of Parties for information on technologies and know-how to mitigate and adapt to climate change |  to prepare a programme of work |  and to report on the progress on these for consideration at the third session of the SBSTA. Such a work programme could consider among its elements options for the future development of a database and assessment of technology and should be elaborated in cooperation with other relevant United Nations agencies and other organizations and institutions. The SBSTA further requested the secretariat to prepare an initial catalogue of adaptation technologies and know-how |  including information on their costs |  environmental impacts |  implementation requirements |  probable time-frames for their introduction and utilization |  and other characteristics for consideration by the SBSTA before the third session of the COP |  and |  on this matter |  coordinate its activities with the IPCC. 85. The SBSTA |  in view of decision 13/CP.1 |  requested the secretariat to prepare a paper for consideration by the SBSTA on information related to the terms of transfer of technology and know-how currently available. 86. The SBSTA further requested the secretariat to inform the SBSTA periodically about new information on technologies and know-how in the research and development stage that may be conducive to mitigating and adapting to climate change and activities aimed at increasing the diffusion and commercialization of such technologies and know-how. |  |  |  | VIII. |  |  |  | WORKSHOP ON MECHANISMS FOR INPUTS BY NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (Agenda item 8) 1. Proceedings |  |  |  | 87. At its 6th meeting |  on 4 March |  the SBSTA considered briefly the matter of the workshop on mechanisms for inputs by non-governmental organizations. The decision to hold the workshop within the framework of the SBSTA was taken by the Conference of the Parties at its first session. It also decided that the workshop would examine the need for |  and possible scope |  structure |  membership and work plans |  of non-governmental advisory committees and/or a business consultative mechanism. The workshop was convened on 2 March 1995 by the International Academy of the Environment (IAE) |  with guidance from the UNFCCC secretariat. It was co-chaired by the Chairman of the SBSTA and the Director of the IAE |  Mr. B. Hawrylyshyn |  who presented an oral report on its proceedings to the SBSTA. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 20 |  |  |  | 2. Conclusions 88. On the basis of a proposal by the Chairman |  the SBSTA |  at its 6th meeting |  on 4 March |  decided to postpone discussions on the workshop until its third session when the formal report would be available in all languages. |  |  |  | IX. |  |  |  | LONGER-TERM ACTIVITIES (Agenda item 9) 1. Proceedings |  |  |  | 89. At its 5th and 6th meetings |  on 1 and 4 March |  respectively |  the SBSTA addressed the item on longer-term activities. 2. Conclusions 90. On the basis of proposals by the Chairman |  the SBSTA |  at its 6th meeting |  on 4 March |  adopted the following conclusions. 91. The SBSTA noted that the Bureau of the COP had decided on the following provisional schedule of meetings for the SBSTA: third session fourth session fifth session during COP 2 |  8-19 July 1996 16-18 December 1996 24-28 February 1997 Bonn Geneva Geneva |  |  |  | 92. The agenda for the third session of the SBSTA would be drafted so as to respond to the need of COP 2 for focused input into its work. A longer-term work programme would be presented to the third session of the SBSTA on the basis of the principles laid out in the annotated agenda (document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/1/Add.1 |  paragraphs 23 and 24) |  taking into account comments from Parties as well as the need for coordination with the SBI. |  |  |  | X. REPORT ON THE SESSION (Agenda item 10) 93. At its 6th meeting |  on 4 March 1996 |  the Rapporteur presented the first part of the draft report of the session (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/L.1).

INTRODUCTION 1. The initial framework for reporting must have a simple and transparent structure. It is expected that subsequent sessions of the COP and its subsidiary bodies could elaborate further on the framework for reporting |  taking into account the information provided by the initial reports transmitted to the secretariat or comments expressed by Parties. 2. The nature of the information contained in the initial reports to be provided by Parties involved in activities implemented jointly will be relevant information for the evaluation of the ongoing pilot phase. |  |  |  | II. INITIAL FRAMEWORK FOR REPORTING ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY A. Who reports? 3. Each national Government of Parties involved in activities implemented jointly should report separately to the COP through the secretariat on a project-by-project basis unless participating Parties agree on a common report on a particular project. Any Party may report on national programmes for activities implemented jointly |  for information purposes only. 4. If the Parties choose not to report jointly |  the secretariat will not process information on that project until reports on that project from all Parties concerned |  particularly developing country Parties |  are transmitted to the secretariat. B. Frequency 5. Reports may be transmitted to the secretariat at any time and should be updated if possible |  preferably each year |  unless participating Parties decide otherwise. C. Contents of the reports 6. The reports should include: |  |  |  | (a) Description of the project (type of the project |  identification of all actors involved |  institutional arrangements |  actual costs to the extent possible |  technical data |  long-term viability of the project |  location |  lifetime |  mutually agreed project assessment procedures |  and so forth); |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 English Page 33 |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | Governmental acceptance |  approval or endorsement; |  |  |  | (c) Compatibility with and supportiveness of national economic development and socio-economic and environment priorities and strategies; (d) Benefits derived from the activities implemented jointly project; |  |  |  | (e) Calculation of the contribution of activities implemented jointly projects that bring about real |  measurable and long-term environmental benefits related to the mitigation of climate change that would not have occurred in the absence of such activities; (f) Additionality to financial obligations of Parties included in Annex II to the Convention within the framework of the financial mechanism as well as to current official development assistance flows; (g) Contribution to capacity building |  transfer of environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties |  particularly developing country Parties |  to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention. In this process |  the developed country Parties shall support the development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing country Parties; (h) Additional comments if any including any practical experience gained or technical difficulties |  effects |  impacts or other obstacles encountered. ----- |  |  |  |

Election of officers other than the Chairman (Agenda item 2 (b)) 7. At its 1st meeting |  on 9 July |  the SBSTA considered the sub-item on the election of officers other than the Chairman. The Chairman informed the SBSTA that the President of the Conference of the Parties was continuing his consultations on the election of officers of the Bureau other than the President. Since the elections of officers of the Conference of the Parties and those of the SBSTA |  the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Ad Hoc Group on Article 13 were being considered as a package |  the SBSTA agreed to the Chairman’s proposal to await the outcome of these consultations before considering further the issue of the election of SBSTA officers other than the Chairman. Subsequently |  it did not prove possible to reach an agreement (see FCCC/CP/1996/15 |  para. 18). |  |  |  | C. Organization of the work of the session (Agenda item 2 (c)) 8. The SBSTA considered the sub-item on organization of the work of the session at its 1st meeting |  on 9 July |  during which the Chairman recalled the need to start on time as otherwise services for interpretation would be lost. He noted that the Conference of the Parties would |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/13 English Page 6 |  |  |  | consider items in an integrated way and therefore coordination would be required between the SBSTA and the SBI on items appearing on the agendas of both these bodies. He expressed his intention to work with the Chairman of the SBI to ensure such coordination. Any recommendations to the COP for the adoption of decisions would be contained in in-session documents of the Conference of the Parties |  combining |  where relevant |  the inputs from the SBSTA and the SBI. 9. Statements were made by the representatives of four Parties. |  |  |  | D.

Statements were made by the representatives of two non-governmental organizations. 2. Conclusions 50. On the basis of a proposal by the Chairman |  the SBSTA |  at its 6th meeting |  on 11 July |  adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA expressed appreciation for documents FCCC/SBSTA/1996/11 and FCCC/SBSTA/1996/MISC.2 on consultative mechanisms for non-governmental inputs to the Convention; (b) The SBSTA recognized the importance of the role which business and industry |  municipal leaders and local authorities |  and environmental organizations can play in implementing the objective of the Convention; (c) The SBSTA welcomed the contributions made at the workshop on consultative mechanisms for non-governmental organization inputs to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held on 2 March 1996. Since consensus on mechanisms for consultation had not yet been reached by non-governmental organizations participating in the workshop |  the SBSTA proposed that for the time being emphasis should be given to improving existing consultative processes; (d) The SBSTA therefore proposed that as a next step the secretariat should explore further with non-governmental groups current mechanisms and procedures for consultation with a view to establishing how they might be made more efficient. The suggestion was made in this regard that it would be helpful also to examine the initiatives that the IPCC is taking to obtain access to a wider range of expertise in the technological areas. On the basis of these discussions |  a paper could be prepared for consideration by the SBSTA at its fourth session with the aim of reaching a conclusive decision on the creation of a consultative mechanism. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/13 English Page 14 |  |  |  | VIII. |  |  |  | PROGRAMME OF WORK (Agenda item 8) |  |  |  | A.

Discussions on this item were held during the 1st |  2nd |  9th and 10th meetings of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) on 9 |  15 and 16 July 1996. 2. The documents prepared for the session (FCCC/CP/1996/5; FCCC/CP/1996/10 |  FCCC/SBSTA/1996/7/Rev.1 and Add.1-3/Rev.1 |  FCCC/SBSTA/1996/MISC.4) |  the previous discussion on the item (see paragraphs 18 to 32 of document FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8) and decision 6/CP.1 outlining the terms of reference of the SBSTA |  formed the backdrop for the discussion. 3. The discussion was prefaced by a statement by the Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) who also responded to questions raised. 4. Statements were made by 50 Parties |  including one on behalf of the European Community and its member States |  another on behalf of the Group of 77 and China |  and another on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States. 5. 6. 7. Representatives of two States not Parties to the Convention also made statements. A representative of one non-governmental organization made a statement. In general |  it was considered that: (a) The Second Assessment Report of the IPCC represents currently the most comprehensive and authoritative assessment of the available scientific and technical information regarding global climate change |  its impacts and policy implications. The authors of the report and all scientists and other experts involved in its preparation were to be commended for the time |  effort and dedication devoted to the report. The Second Assessment Report should be considered in its entirety. |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/13 English Page 22 |  |  |  | 8. |  |  |  | It was noted that: (a) The Second Assessment Report gives an assessment of the likelihood of current and future climate change and related impacts |  taking into account remaining uncertainties. The Second Assessment Report considers the vulnerability of natural and human systems to climate change |  and thresholds of damage |  but does not quantify what constitutes  dangerous anthropogenic interference  with the climate system as defined in Article 2 of the Convention. Such an assessment will be required to fully address the ultimate objective of the Convention. More information will be required on regional scenarios of climate change and more effort should be directed at reducing uncertainties in current knowledge of climate change.  No regrets  policies and measures were available for immediate use in many countries at little or no cost. There are large differences in the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions |  and enhancing sinks |  among countries due to their states of economic development |  infrastructure choices |  and natural resource base. The socio-economic impacts on |  and vulnerability of most developing countries in such areas as agriculture |  water resources and public health |  particularly in those countries with low-lying coastal areas and the small island developing States |  must be taken into account. The vulnerability of many countries |  including developing countries and countries relying on production of fossil fuels |  to the economic impacts of potential policies or measures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be addressed. There is a need for all Parties to meet their commitments taking into account the need for equity and differentiated responsibilities. |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | (d) |  |  |  | (e) |  |  |  | (f) |  |  |  | (g) |  |  |  | 9. There were divergent views on the implications of the Second Assessment Report for the Convention. Views were expressed that the Second Assessment Report provides a reliable basis for Parties to take further action to mitigate climate change and that it should be considered carefully by the Conference of the Parties (COP) and particularly by the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM) |  in their future activities |  as a basis for urgent action. Views were also expressed that due to the scientific uncertainties and lack of sufficient economic analysis in the Second Assessment Report it would be premature to take action beyond appropriate ’no regrets’ policies and measures to mitigate climate change now |  and that more research is required |  and that the Second Assessment Report does not provide adequate information to determine what constitutes dangerous levels of greenhouse gas concentrations to use the report for achieving the objective of the Convention (Article 2). |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/13 English Page 23 |  |  |  | 10. In subsequent discussion |  the SBSTA prepared the following draft decision |  but could not reach consensus on its paragraph 1 |  as indicated in the draft by two alternatives in square brackets. 11. The SBSTA authorized its Chairman to convey this draft decision to the COP |  with the request that COP further consider it with a view to reaching agreement on a decision regarding the use of the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC. |  |  |  | Draft decision -/CP.2 Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change |  |  |  | The Conference of the Parties |  Recalling the mandate of the SBSTA as given in Article 9 and decision 6/CP.1 (FCCC/CP/7/Add.1) to |  Provide assessments of the state of scientific knowledge relating to climate change and its effects (Article 9.2 (a)). In this context: (a) Summarize and |  where necessary |  convert the latest international scientific |  technical |  socio-economic and other information provided by competent bodies |  including |  inter alia |  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) |  into forms appropriate to the needs of the Conference of the Parties |  (b) Compile and synthesize scientific |  technical and socio-economic information on the global situation on climate change |  provided by |  inter alia |  the IPCC |  as well as on the latest developments in science |  to the extent possible |  and assess the implications thereof for the implementation of the Convention; and formulate requests to competent international scientific and technical bodies |  Recalling also that the SBSTA held an exchange of views on the Second Assessment Report during its second and third sessions (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8 and ..) and the recommendations of the SBSTA |  Notes that the Second Assessment Report needs to be considered as a whole; |  |  |  | Considers the Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to be the most comprehensive and authoritative assessment now available of the scientific and technical information regarding global climate change; |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1996/13 English Page 24 |  |  |  | 1. [Decides that |  the Second Assessment Report be used as basis for urgent action to further the implementation of the Convention and for developing a protocol or other legal instrument |  as provided for in the Berlin Mandate;] 1. [Decides that |  the Second Assessment Report should be taken into account during consideration of the implementation of the Convention |  including informing the process of negotiation |  bearing in mind the uncertainties and lack of certain information in the report. Furthermore |  the lack of the assessment of the dangerous levels of the concentration of greenhouse gases for the climate system does not allow to use the Second Assessment Report for achieving the main goal of the Convention (Article 2);] 2. Expresses its appreciation to the IPCC |  particularly the Chairman of the IPCC and all its authors and scientists |  for their excellent work in drawing up the Second Assessment Report; 3. Welcomes the commitment of the IPCC to undertake the work programme requested in support of SBSTA and AGBM; 4. Urges continuing cooperation between the Convention bodies and the IPCC. |  |  |  | ----- |  |  |  |

The SBSTA acknowledged the importance of the technical work under this agenda sub-item for the implementation of the second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol. It noted that the initial assessment indicated that there is a considerable amount of work to be done on several decisions on methodological issues under the Kyoto Protocol |  which should be addressed. 123. To facilitate further progress on this agenda sub-item in 2012 |  the SBSTA: |  |  |  | (a) Requested the secretariat to prepare a technical paper that includes a comprehensive identification of the implications of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 5/CMP.7 on the previous CMP decisions on methodological issues related to the Kyoto Protocol |  including those relating to Articles 5 |  7 and 8 |  building on the presentations made by the secretariat to the SBSTA at its thirty-sixth session and discussions by Parties at that session |  and to indicate the technical issues that are relevant to implement these decisions in the second commitment period. The technical paper should include options to address the relevant methodological decisions |  with annotations explaining the rationale for these suggested options and the relationship of the suggested options to decisions 2/CMP.7 to 5/CMP.7. This would include identification of paragraphs in methodological decisions where further guidance from Parties is needed. Where applicable |  the implications identified should be clustered into generic categories with the aim of ensuring a consistent approach across decisions. The secretariat may also address technical issues arising from the implementation of previous CMP decisions on methodological issues identified in the first commitment period. The technical paper will provide the basis for discussions by participants at the technical workshop mentioned in paragraph 123(d) below. It will also be made available for consideration by Parties at the thirty-seventh session of the SBSTA. The technical paper should be available by 1 September 2012; (b) Invited Parties to submit to the secretariat |  by 21 September 2012 |  their views on the implications of the implementation of decisions 2/CMP.7 to 5/CMP.7 on the previous CMP decisions on methodological issues related to the Kyoto Protocol |  including those relating to Articles 5 |  7 and 8 of the Kyoto Protocol |  and on how these implications should be addressed; (c) Requested the secretariat to make these submissions available on the UNFCCC website and to compile them into a miscellaneous document before the workshop referred to in paragraph 123(d) below; (d) Further requested the secretariat to organize a technical workshop |  to be held before the thirty-seventh session of the SBSTA |  with the aim of facilitating progress in the consideration of this agenda sub-item at that session to discuss the technical paper referred to in paragraph 123(a) above and to consider Parties’ views referred to in paragraph 123(b) above. It requested the secretariat to prepare a report on the workshop before the thirtyseventh session of the SBSTA. 124.

The SBSTA welcomed the progress report by the GTOS secretariat on this matter and took note of the different options for such a framework presented therein.21 The SBSTA encouraged the GTOS secretariat and the sponsoring agencies of GTOS to continue developing the framework in the way they consider most appropriate |  making use of existing institutional bodies and processes |  where appropriate |  and taking into account that such a framework should meet the following criteria: (a) (b) (c) (d) Standards should be developed on a scientifically sound basis; The framework should provide for the involvement of governments in the development of standards and guidance materials and in their implementation; Access to those standards and guidance materials should be free and unrestricted; The process for developing the standards and guidance materials and the operation of the framework should be cost-effective and sustainable and take into account existing standards and guidance materials; The framework should be flexible in view of future needs and developments in this area. |  |  |  | (e) |  |  |  | 41. The SBSTA commended the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) and the Parties supporting space agencies on the progress made in 2007 in implementing actions in response to the GCOS implementation plan |  and looks forward to continued progress during 2008. The SBSTA invited the CEOS to provide an updated progress report by its twenty-ninth session. The SBSTA noted the continued close working relationship between GCOS and the CEOS for linking space-based capabilities with global climate observing requirements. 42. The SBSTA welcomed the Cape Town Declaration22 adopted at the Group on Earth Observations Ministerial Summit |  which recognizes the important contribution the Global Earth Observation System of Systems can make in response to the needs of the Convention and the growing need to further enhance such contributions. The SBSTA noted that such contributions will be made mainly through GCOS. 43. The SBSTA noted that systematic and continuous observations have significantly contributed to the key findings of the AR4 of the IPCC and play an integral and increasingly important role in monitoring and assessing impacts of |  and in supporting adaptation to |  climate change |  as well as in contributing to the reduction of uncertainties. The SBSTA noted the importance of robust scientific information derived from the state-of-the-art observing technologies as well as conventional observations for supporting scientific assessment to inform action to address climate change. |  |  |  | 20 |  |  |  | As mandated |  the GTOS secretariat provided a progress report on this matter to the SBSTA at its twenty-sixth session (FCCC/SBSTA/2007/MISC.6). It provided an update to this report prior to the twenty-seventh session of the SBSTA (FCCC/SBSTA/2007/MISC.27). 21 See footnote 20. 22 Available at <http://earthobservations.org/>. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2007/16 Page 11 44. The SBSTA was informed of the workshop organized by GCOS |  the World Climate Research Programme and the International Geosphere–Biosphere Programme | 23 held in Sydney |  Australia |  in October 2007 |  which examined |  among other issues |  requirements for future systematic observations resulting from the findings of the IPCC AR4. The workshop reinforced the importance of sustaining the long-term operation of the climate observing systems which provide the essential climate variables set down in the GCOS implementation plan and highlighted the need for Parties to share their data freely. The SBSTA noted that such efforts are particularly urgent in developing countries; however |  it was noted that a number of areas also need to be addressed in developed countries. |  |  |  | VII.

The SBSTA reaffirmed the importance of meetings of lead reviewers and requested the secretariat to continue to organize these meetings. The SBSTA encouraged Parties in a position to do so to ensure proper funding for this activity. 60. The SBSTA acknowledged the commendable effort made by Parties and experts |  supported by the secretariat |  that made it possible to conduct 40 reviews in 2007 |  including 36 in-country reviews |  and publish the corresponding review reports under established deadlines.30 However |  it noted that the review process needs further strengthening |  in particular through the participation of an increased number of well-trained review experts and more support from the secretariat to continue with the review procedures established by the UNFCCC review guidelines.30 61. The SBSTA acknowledged the problems indicated in the report referred to in paragraph 57 above |  in particular some delays in the preparation of final reports |  a lack of sufficient experts being available |  resulting in individual experts having to participate in multiple reviews |  and the lack of funding to continue and improve the training of new review experts. |  | 27 28 |  |  |  | For the text as adopted |  see document FCCC/CP/2007/6/Add.1 |  decision 5/CP.13. Adopted as document FCCC/SBSTA/2007/L.12. 29 FCCC/SBSTA/2007/INF.4. 30 “UNFCCC guidelines for the technical review of greenhouse gas inventories from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention”. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2007/16 Page 13 62. The SBSTA noted that several Parties did not nominate experts for the roster of experts and that a number of experts nominated to the roster of experts did not participate in the reviews | 31 contributing to the problems identified in paragraph 61 above. The SBSTA strongly encouraged these Parties to nominate experts to the roster of experts and |  to this end |  encouraged Parties to update |  at least once a year |  the roster of experts by nominating new experts where necessary and removing from the roster experts who are no longer available. The SBSTA further encouraged Parties to ensure that experts nominated to the roster of experts participate in the training programme and |  providing they have passed the mandatory training |  that they are made available to participate in the review process. 63. The SBSTA further noted the importance of the training programme for new experts to the review of GHG inventories under the Convention. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to update the training programme to take into account the methodological developments in GHG inventories and the experience gained in the review process |  and to continue as soon as possible with the training of review experts nominated to the roster of experts |  subject to the availability of resources. The SBSTA strongly encouraged Parties in a position to do so to provide the necessary funding for the training programme. 64. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to continue the development and maintenance of the software tools for reporting and reviewing GHG information |  including CRF Reporter |  and to organize in 2008 a meeting of the users of CRF Reporter in order to establish priorities for further development to take into account the experiences of users |  subject to the availability of resources. The SBSTA encouraged Parties in a position to do so to ensure proper funding of these activities. 65. The SBSTA reiterated the need for continued analysis of the effectiveness of the review process in implementing decision 12/CP.9 and the conclusions of the SBSTA at its twenty-fourth session.32 66. The SBSTA also noted with concern the high volume of work in 2008 related to the reviews of the national communications |  the rescheduled reviews of 2007 inventory submissions and the forthcoming reviews of 2008 inventory submissions. This will place considerable pressure on |  and demand for resources from |  the Parties |  review experts and the secretariat. 67. The SBSTA further noted that in accordance with the conclusions by the COP at its twelfth session |  there is a need for continued flexibility in the timing of the review activities for the 2007 inventory submissions and that for those Parties where an in-country review of the 2006 inventory submission was conducted in 2007 |  the review of the 2007 inventory submission should be conducted in conjunction with the review of the 2008 inventory submission |  with a focus on the most recent submission. The SBSTA requested the lead reviewers to consider this issue at their next meeting and make recommendations on how to implement this flexibility. B. Greenhouse gas data interface (Agenda item 8 (b)) 1. Proceedings 68. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 3rd and 4th meetings |  on 4 and 11 December |  respectively. At its 3rd meeting |  the SBSTA agreed to consider this sub-item in informal consultations convened by the Chair with the assistance of Mr. Len Brown (New Zealand). At the 4th meeting |  Mr. Brown reported on these consultations. 69. At its 4th meeting |  the SBSTA considered draft conclusions33 proposed by the Chair |  and adopted them as amended by the Chair. |  | 31 32 |  |  |  | See FCCC/SBSTA/2007/INF.4 |  table 1 |  for a list of Parties that provided experts for reviews conducted in 2007.

The SBSTA welcomed the progress made by the secretariat in providing a simple and userfriendly interface to assist Parties in searching and sorting available GHG inventory data.34 The SBSTA noted with appreciation that the secretariat completed its work before its twenty-seventh session.35 71. The SBSTA recognized that the interface requires continuous support from |  and maintenance by |  the secretariat |  which has resource implications. The SBSTA invited Parties in a position to do so to provide resources for support and maintenance of the interface. 72. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to use population and gross domestic product (GDP) data that are publicly available on the website of the Statistics Division of the United Nations | 36 noting that the sources of population and GDP data may need to be further considered at a future session. The exact source of the data used should be clearly shown on the interface. 73. The SBSTA noted that the common reporting format (CRF) data prepared using the CRF Reporter software are readily available for import into the UNFCCC GHG database. The import of data in other formats may have resource implications. 74. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to include on the interface |  by its twenty-ninth session |  a new function to provide |  in a simple and user-friendly form |  the facility to calculate user-defined indicators from the emissions |  population and GDP data available through the interface |  subject to the availability of resources. 75. The SBSTA also requested the secretariat to develop |  before its twenty-eighth session |  a separate section on the interface providing access to total national emissions data for the base year under the Kyoto Protocol for the Parties included in Annex I to the Convention that are also Parties to the Kyoto Protocol |  as soon as these data have been reviewed and finalized through the initial review process. 76. The SBSTA agreed to consider |  at its twenty-ninth session |  matters relating to the further development of the interface with a view to evaluating progress and determining further steps |  including the possibility to include information related to the Kyoto Protocol in the interface.

The SBSTA noted that the “Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention |  Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories” and the “Guidelines for the technical review of greenhouse gas inventories from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention” have proved to be valuable tools in improving the consistency |  timeliness |  completeness |  comparability |  and transparency of GHG inventories. 90. The SBSTA concluded that it is not necessary to update the above-mentioned guidelines at its twenty-fourth session. 91. The SBSTA also noted that inventory experts from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) and Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention that participate in review training and in the review of Annex I Party GHG inventories gain additional benefits in terms of capacitybuilding. 92. The SBSTA encouraged Parties to nominate additional experts to the roster of experts and to take the necessary steps to ensure the availability of experts to participate in the review process. 93. The SBSTA welcomed the fact that more than 100 experts received training organized by the secretariat and subsequently participated in the expert review teams in 2003–2005. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to continue its training programme for inventory review experts nominated to the roster of experts |  and encouraged Parties to support the review training programme activities. 94. The SBSTA requested the lead reviewers to include in the discussion at their next meeting the following issues: the experience gained and the lessons learned regarding confidentiality of information |  conflicts among team members |  consistency of reviews and how recommendations formulated by expert review teams contribute to improving reporting by Parties. 95. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to continue to prepare annual reports on inventory review activities |  pursuant to decision 12/CP.9 |  for consideration by the SBSTA |  and to include in these reports information on progress in updating the roster of experts. |  |  |  | VIII.

The purpose of the recommendations presented in the annex is to identify specific actions for enhancing the implementation of the framework for meaningful and effective actions to enhance the implementation of Article 4 |  paragraph 5 |  of the Convention (referred to hereinafter as the technology transfer framework) |  as requested by decision 6/CP.10. 2. These recommendations were developed taking into account: (a) Experience and lessons learned from the implementation of the technology transfer framework since its adoption by the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its seventh session (decision 4/CP.7); Progress of the work and the activities completed since the inception of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) in 2001 and the outcomes of its deliberations; Relevant ongoing activities relating to the development and transfer of technologies of various national |  regional and international organizations |  governments and the private sector |  in different forums; That the work on advancing the uptake of mitigation technologies and technologies for adaptation to climate change involves cross-cutting activities and |  as such |  normally is implemented under multiple key themes of the framework; The need to promote a broader involvement of Parties |  international organizations |  the private sector (in particular business and industry as well as the financial community) |  technology practitioners and other relevant stakeholders for the implementation of the framework; The need to strike a balance between strategic and operational actions |  whereby the strategic actions are implemented by organizing technical workshops and expert meetings. These lead to the preparation of reports |  technical papers and other tools on specific issues that provide technical inputs and operational guidance for the benefit of Parties and other users. |  |  |  | (b) (c) |  |  |  | (d) |  |  |  | (e) |  |  |  | (f) |  |  |  | 3. The existing structure |  five thematic areas of work |  definitions and purpose under the current technology transfer framework contained in the annex to decision 4/CP.7 continue to provide a solid basis for implementing the provisions of the Article 4 |  paragraph 5 |  of the Convention. 4. Given that technology is one of the important elements for discussions on the future long-term cooperative actions to address climate change by enhancing implementation of the Convention |  the suggested time frame for the implementation of the actions outlined below is for the medium term covering the period between 2007 and 2012 or until the eighteenth session of the COP (2012). These recommendations address the medium-term work |  pending the results of the Dialogue on long-term cooperative actions on climate change by enhancing implementation of the Convention (Dialogue). |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2006/5* Page 32 5. The implementation of the recommendations presented below should be considered as further actions for enhancing the implementation of Article 4 |  paragraph 5 |  of the Convention set out in the technology transfer framework. 6. Work developed under each key theme has evolved to a more practical and results-oriented level and should continue to do so by promoting actions in specific sectors and regions. Therefore |  there is a need to undertake periodic review on implementation of the framework and its effectiveness. 7. The EGTT recognized the need for financial and technical support to enable the Parties not included in the Annex I to the Convention (non-Annex I Parties) to implement the recommended actions below. In this regard Parties |  when considering these recommendations |  may wish to consider ways and means to address these needs. A. Technology needs and needs assessments 8.

Methodological issues under the Convention |  | (Agenda item 10) |  |  |  | A. |  |  |  | Work programme on the revision of the guidelines for the review of biennial reports and national communications |  including national inventory reviews |  for developed country Parties |  | (Agenda sub-item 10(a)) Proceedings 86. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 2nd and 3rd meetings. It had before it document FCCC/SBSTA/2013/INF.2. A statement was made by a representative of one Party on behalf of the LDCs. 87. At its 2nd meeting |  the SBSTA agreed to consider this sub-item in a contact group |  co-chaired by Ms. Riitta Pipatti (Finland) and Mr. Qiang Liu (China). At its 3rd meeting |  the SBSTA considered and adopted conclusions23 proposed by the Chair. |  |  |  | 1. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Conclusions 88. The SBSTA continued its discussion on the revision of the guidelines for the review of biennial reports and national communications |  including national inventory reviews |  for developed country Parties (hereinafter referred to as the review guidelines) |  with a view to: (a) Completing the revision of the communications and biennial reports by COP 19; review guidelines for national |  |  |  | (b) Completing the revision of the “Guidelines for the technical review of greenhouse gas inventories from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention” by COP 20 (December 2014). 89. SBSTA 37 requested the lead reviewers to discuss |  at their meeting in 2013 |  options to improve the cost-effectiveness |  efficiency and practicality of the review process. SBSTA 38 took note of the information contained in the conclusions and recommendations of the 10th meeting of inventory lead reviewers in response to this request. 24 90. The SBSTA noted that the appropriate streamlining 25 of the review process could improve its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The SBSTA also noted that potential and appropriate streamlining of the review process will be considered |  while ensuring the transparency and quality of the review process. 91. The SBSTA concluded that the review of national communications should be conducted in conjunction with the review of biennial reports in the years when both reports are submitted. The SBSTA agreed that the same information submitted by Parties in national communications |  biennial reports and national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories would be reviewed only once. 92. The SBSTA noted that reviews of national communications and biennial reports could be conducted through a combination of in-country and centralized reviews |  only through centralized reviews |  or only through in-country reviews. The SBSTA also acknowledged the concerns raised by Parties with small-scale economies with respect to the |  | 23 24 25 |  |  |  | Adopted as document FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.10. FCCC/SBSTA/2013/INF.2 |  paragraphs 9–14. The need to have the cost-effective |  efficient and practical review processes without compromising the quality. 17 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2013/3 |  |  |  | format of the reviews and that further discussions on the specific format and combination of reviews could be carried out during the workshop to be held in October 2013 |  referred to in paragraph 95 below. 93. The SBSTA concluded that the option of supplementing the current expert review teams (ERTs) with a standing group of experts |  or introducing service fees for review experts |  could be explored with respect to the impact on the quality |  efficiency and costs of the review process. 94. The SBSTA identified two alternatives to detailing and structuring the work on the revision of the review guidelines: (a) Alternative 1: the revision of the review guidelines for national communications |  biennial reports and GHG inventories envisages that the structure and key elements of the review guidelines would comprise the following: (i) The general approach to the review |  including |  inter alia |  the overall objectives |  timing and procedures |  ERTs and institutional arrangements |  reporting and publication; (ii) Specific requirements for the review of national communications |  including |  inter alia |  the purpose and scope of reviews |  timing and reporting; (iii) Specific requirements for the review of biennial reports |  including |  inter alia |  the purpose and scope of reviews |  timing and reporting; (iv) Specific requirements for the review of GHG inventories |  including |  inter alia |  the purpose and scope of reviews |  timing and reporting; (b) Alternative 2: the review guidelines for national communications |  biennial reports and GHG inventories should be three separate review guidelines. 95. The SBSTA concluded that the technical workshop to be held in October 201326 should focus first on mapping information requirements contained in the biennial report and national communication reporting guidelines to identify overlapping reporting requirements (e.g. substantively common and duplicated information) and unique information in the biennial reports and national communications. Reporting information identified as unique to biennial reports could serve as the starting point for a discussion for developing biennial report review guidelines. Information identified as overlapping to national communication and biennial report reporting guidelines could serve as input to a discussion on streamlining of the review process. Parties concluded that both discussions should take place at the October 2013 workshop |  to be organized by the secretariat under the guidance of the Chair of the SBSTA. 96. The SBSTA invited Parties |  in accordance with the work programme on the revision of the review guidelines agreed upon at SBSTA 37 |  to submit to the secretariat |  by 15 July 2013 |  additional views on |  inter alia |  the scope |  structure |  timing |  outline and publication of review reports |  and specific views on key elements and content and proposed texts |  of the review guidelines for national communications and biennial reports. It requested the secretariat to prepare |  by 15 September 2013 |  a synthesis report of Parties’ views and a draft of the review guidelines based on the Parties’ submissions |  in which the options proposed by Parties should be traceable in a transparent manner |  as inputs to the discussions at the October 2013 workshop. 97. The SBSTA highlighted the importance of training for the review of biennial reports and national communications |  in particular for experts from developing countries. The SBSTA further requested the secretariat to begin the development of new training materials |  | 26 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2012/5 |  annex I. |  |  |  | 18 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2013/3 |  |  |  | and procedures before the review of the next submission of the national communications and the submission of the first biennial reports. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to present developed training materials and procedures at SBSTA 39. The development of training materials should cover the reporting requirements and the procedures for the general aspects of the review process. The SBSTA agreed to consider |  at SBSTA 39 |  the next steps in the development of the training materials. 98. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to review and |  if necessary |  to make changes to the nomination form for the UNFCCC roster of experts. Furthermore |  the SBSTA requested the secretariat to inform Parties of any changes to the nomination form |  including of a request to nominate experts for the reviews of biennial reports. The SBSTA recommended that Parties update and expand the UNFCCC roster of experts by September 2013 in order to meet the particular expertise needs of the reviews of biennial reports and national communications. 99. The SBSTA took note of the estimated budgetary implications of the activities to be undertaken by the secretariat as referred to in paragraphs 95 and 97 above. 100. The SBSTA requested that the actions of the secretariat called for in these conclusions be undertaken subject to the availability of financial resources. |  |  |  | B. |  |  |  | General guidelines for domestic measurement |  reporting and verification of domestically supported nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing country Parties |  | (Agenda sub-item 10(b)) Proceedings 101.

The SBSTA took note of the views submitted by Parties |  contained in document FCCC/SBSTA/2013/MISC.14 and Add.1 |  on their experience during a trial use of the revised “Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention |  Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual greenhouse gas inventories” (hereinafter referred to as the UNFCCC Annex I inventory reporting guidelines) and the upgraded common reporting format (CRF) Reporter. 109. The SBSTA noted the continuing progress of the work undertaken by the IPCC relevant to the work programme on the revision of the “Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention |  Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories” |  as agreed to at SBSTA 30. In particular |  the SBSTA welcomed the progress made on the 2013 Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories: Wetlands |  with the government and expert review of the second-order draft of that document undertaken in February 2013. 110. On the basis of the consideration of the Parties’ views referred to in paragraph 108 above |  and the discussions at SBSTA 38 |  the SBSTA advanced its work on the draft UNFCCC Annex I inventory reporting guidelines |  including on the CRF tables |  as contained in document FCCC/SBSTA/2013/3/Add.2 |  and agreed to continue its discussions at SBSTA 39 |  with a view to forwarding a draft decision for consideration and adoption by COP 19. 111. The SBSTA identified the need to further consider |  at SBSTA 39 |  the reporting of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions related to ammonia production and urea application and the supplementary guidance on wetlands referred to in paragraph 109 above. Regarding CO2 emissions related to ammonia production and urea application |  the SBSTA invited Parties to discuss this issue further |  with a view to arriving at a common understanding of how and where to report the associated emissions. Regarding wetlands |  the SBSTA invited Parties to consider how to reflect the supplementary guidance on wetlands referred to in paragraph 109 above in the UNFCCC Annex I inventory reporting guidelines |  and in particular in the CRF tables. It also invited Parties to submit to the secretariat |  by 25 October 2013 |  their views on these matters. 112. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to make the submissions from Parties referred to in paragraph 111 above available on the UNFCCC website. 113. The SBSTA noted that the completion of the upgraded CRF Reporter |  at the latest in June 2014 |  is critical to enable Parties to use it for the submission of their annual inventories in 2015. It requested the secretariat to continue to improve the CRF Reporter in response to the Parties’ views referred to in paragraph 108 above and the outcomes of |  | 29 |  |  |  | Adopted as document FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.15. |  |  |  | 20 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2013/3 |  |  |  | SBSTA 38 |  with a view to making an improved version of the CRF Reporter available to Parties for testing in the fourth quarter of 2013. The SBSTA also requested the secretariat to prepare a final version of the upgraded CRF Reporter for release |  at the latest |  in June 2014. 114. The SBSTA discussed the reporting of GHG emissions/removals from harvested wood products (HWPs) and noted that there may be differences in reporting by countries due to the alternative approaches to estimate the contribution of HWPs to annual CO 2 emissions/removals. Some Parties agreed with the multiple approaches to reporting as consistent with the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories; other Parties expressed a preference for a single |  common approach in order to ensure comparability of reporting across Parties. Concern regarding the possibility of double counting or underestimating emissions/removals as a result of the use of multiple reporting approaches was also raised. The SBSTA agreed to continue discussions on the reporting of emissions/removals from HWPs at SBSTA 39. 115. The SBSTA took note of the estimated budgetary implications of the completion of the activities to be undertaken by the secretariat as referred to in paragraph 113 above. 116. The SBSTA requested that the actions of the secretariat called for in these conclusions be undertaken subject to the availability of financial resources. |  |  |  | D. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Greenhouse gas data interface |  | (Agenda sub-item 10(d)) Proceedings 117.

On the technical design of the NMM: (a) Its operation under the guidance and authority of the COP: how should the COP exercise its guidance and authority over the NMM |  what should the institutional arrangements for the NMM be |  and what should the role of the UNFCCC be in relation to the individual Parties that implement the NMM? (b) The voluntary participation of Parties in the mechanism: how should this be ensured |  and how can the NMM incentivize wider Party participation? (c) Standards that deliver real |  permanent |  additional |  and verified mitigation outcomes |  avoid double counting of effort and achieve a net decrease and/or avoidance of GHG emissions: what are these standards |  how should they be developed and applied |  and what lessons should be learned from other experience |  including under the Kyoto Protocol? (d) Requirements for the accurate measurement |  reporting and verification of emission reductions |  emission removals and/or avoided emissions: what are these requirements |  how should they be applied |  and what lessons should be learned from other experience |  including under the Kyoto Protocol? (e) Means to stimulate mitigation across broad segments of the economy |  which are defined by the participating Parties and may be on a sectoral and/or project-specific basis: what are examples of such segments |  how should the NMM stimulate mitigation within them |  and on what basis should the participating Parties define them? (f) Criteria |  including the application of conservative methods |  for the establishment |  approval and periodic adjustment of ambitious reference levels (crediting thresholds and/or trading caps) and for the periodic issuance of units based on mitigation below a crediting threshold or based on a trading cap: what are these criteria and how should they be applied? (g) Criteria for the accurate and consistent recording and tracking of units: what are these criteria |  how should they be applied |  what technical systems need to be in place and what lessons should be learned from other experience |  including under the Kyoto Protocol? (h) Supplementarity: should this be defined and ensured and |  if so |  how? (i) A share of proceeds to cover administrative expenses and assist developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change to meet the costs of adaptation: should there be a share of proceeds and |  if so |  how should it be structured and applied and at what level should it be set? (j) The promotion of sustainable development: how can the NMM promote this? (k) The facilitation of the effective participation of private and public entities: how should the NMM facilitate such participation and how can its incentives be structured appropriately? (l) The facilitation of the prompt start of the mechanism: what measures should be taken to facilitate the prompt start of the NMM and what criteria should be in place? (m) Eligibility criteria for the use of the mechanism: should there be such criteria and |  if so |  what are they and how and to whom should they be applied? (n) Role of the implementing Party: what should be the role of the implementing Party in the operation of the NMM? |  | 31 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2013/3 |  |  |  | (o) the NMM? |  |  |  | Governance: what measures can be taken to ensure the good governance of |  |  |  | 175.

The representative of the Executive Secretary informed Parties that a number of activities resulting from the negotiations at the session call for more support by the secretariat and will therefore require additional resources in the coming year over and above the core budget for this year |  and for the proposed budget for 2014–2015. A preliminary estimated amount of an additional EUR 1.8 million will need to be provided to cover the following activities: (a) Under agenda item 3 |  “Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change” |  the secretariat has been requested to prepare a technical paper before SBSTA 39 and to organize a technical expert meeting prior to SBSTA 40. The cost of those activities is estimated at EUR 170 | 000 |  which is largely to cover the costs of participation in the meeting; (b) Under agenda sub-item 10(a) |  “Work programme on the revision of the guidelines for the review of biennial reports and national communications |  including national inventory reviews |  for developed country Parties” |  the secretariat has been requested to develop new training materials and procedures and to present them at SBSTA 39. The estimated cost amounts to EUR 60 | 000 |  which is for the development of the training materials; (c) Under agenda sub-item 10(c) |  “Revision of the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories for Parties included in Annex I to the Convention” |  the secretariat has been requested to improve |  and prepare a final version of |  the upgraded CRF Reporter for release by June 2014. The estimated cost amounts to EUR 1 | 110 | 000 |  which is for information technology services; (d) Under agenda sub-item 10(d) |  “Greenhouse gas data interface” |  the secretariat has been requested to implement any necessary technical changes to the GHG data interface should the revised “Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention |  Part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual greenhouse gas inventories” be adopted at COP 19 |  at a cost of EUR 243 | 000 |  which is for information technology development work; |  |  |  | 62 63 |  |  |  | Adopted as document FCCC/SBSTA/2013/L.1. While decision 16/CP.9 refers to “decisions” |  it also has implications for conclusions of the subsidiary bodies. 35 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2013/3 |  |  |  | (e) Under agenda sub-item 11(b) |  “Land use |  land-use change and forestry under Article 3 |  paragraphs 3 and 4 |  of the Kyoto Protocol and under the clean development mechanism” |  the secretariat has been requested to organize a workshop on LULUCF activities to be held before or in conjunction with SBSTA 39. An amount of EUR 150 | 000 |  if the workshop is not held in conjunction with SBSTA 39 |  will be required |  which is for participation in the workshop; (f) Under agenda item 12 |  “Market and non-market mechanisms under the Convention” |  the secretariat has been requested to organize workshops on FVA |  NMA and the NMM. The secretariat has some funding available |  but an additional EUR 57 | 000 is required; 64 (g) Some small financial requirements identified for agenda items 4 and 9 may be required |  but the secretariat will seek to absorb those costs. 199.

Statements were made by representatives of 10 Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. 29. At its 3rd meeting |  the SBSTA agreed to continue its consideration by way of informal consultations convened by Mr. Meira Filho (Brazil) and Mr. Murray Ward (New Zealand). At the 7th meeting |  a report was given by Mr. Ward on these consultations. 2. Conclusions 30. At its 7th meeting |  on 29 October |  having considered a proposal by the Chair |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA took note of the report of the expert meeting contained in document FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.14; (b) The SBSTA recalled that |  at its fourteenth session |  it requested the secretariat to continue to coordinate the review of the proposal by Brazil |  to facilitate the dissemination of scientific and methodological information on this proposal |  to broaden participation and to build scientific understanding of this subject. It noted that a number of scientific and methodological issues remained and acknowledged with appreciation the work that had been done; (c) The SBSTA agreed that work on the scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil should be continued by the scientific community |  in particular to improve the robustness of the preliminary results and to explore the uncertainty and sensitivity of the results to different assumptions; (d) The SBSTA agreed that such work should be of a standard consistent with the practices of peer-reviewed published science. The process should be inclusive |  open and transparent; (e) The SBSTA noted that |  for the purpose of validating the models against observed climate |  the analysis should also include factors influencing global climate other than the greenhouse gases covered by the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol; (f) The SBSTA recognized the relevance of this work and the opportunity of this process to build capacity in climate change science. Hence |  the SBSTA strongly encouraged Parties and institutions in a position to do so to facilitate such capacity-building in developing countries |  including by hosting scientists from developing countries. It also encouraged both Annex I Parties and non-Annex I Parties to develop |  if necessary |  cooperative agreements to facilitate such capacity-building; |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2002/13 English Page 12 (g) The SBSTA invited the scientific community |  including scientific and assessment programmes |  such as the International Geosphere–Biosphere Programme |  the World Climate Research Programme |  the International Human Dimensions Programme on Global Environmental Change and the IPCC |  to provide information to Parties |  and each other |  on their interests in the work; (h) The SBSTA invited research institutions and scientists involved in the review of the scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil |  and those interested in becoming involved in future work |  to provide information to Parties |  inter alia |  on the following: (i) Their approach to assessing and continuing the preliminary analysis undertaken to date |  including comparing the preliminary results and assessing their uncertainty; The process by which such contributions could lead to peer-reviewed published results; An approach to efficient coordination of the work and how to ensure transparency; Their resources available for facilitating active participation |  particularly that of developing country experts; |  |  |  | (ii) (iii) (iv) |  |  |  | (i) The SBSTA encouraged research institutions and scientists involved to undertake further work on scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil |  to make the results of their work publicly available and to report the progress of their work at the twentieth session of the SBSTA. The SBSTA requested the secretariat to organize a side event on this issue at the same session; (j) The SBSTA decided to review the progress of the work on the scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil at its twenty-third session. G. Special circumstances of Croatia under Article 4 |  paragraph 6 |  of the Convention (Agenda item 4 (g)) 1. Proceedings 31. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 2nd and 6th meetings |  on 23 and 29 October |  respectively. No new document was produced for this item. Statements were made by representatives of four Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. 32. At its 2nd meeting |  the SBSTA agreed to continue its consideration by way of informal consultations convened by Mr. Jim Penman (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). At the 6th meeting |  a report was given by Mr. Penman on these consultations. 2. Conclusions 33. At its 6th meeting |  on 29 October |  having considered a proposal by the Chair |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA |  in response to a request from the SBI at its fifteenth session (FCCC/SBI/2001/18 |  para. 6) |  considered during its sixteenth and seventeenth sessions a request from Croatia concerning the estimates of its base year emissions (FCCC/SBI/2001/MISC.3); |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2002/13 English Page 13 (b) The SBSTA noted that Article 4 |  paragraph 6 |  of the Convention applies to Croatia as a country undergoing the process of transition to a market economy. It also noted that this article does not specify how flexibility should be allowed. Heretofore |  five Parties have been allowed flexibility in the choice of their reference or base year; (c) The SBSTA noted that Croatia wishes to use the year 1990 as a reference or base year with a level of emissions of 39.4 million tonnes CO2 equivalent under Article 4 |  paragraph 6; (d) The SBSTA noted further that Croatia developed and used its own methodology to determine this level. Application of this method |  based on the population of Croatia relative to that of former Yugoslavia |  increases base year emissions by 7.4 million tonnes CO2 equivalent over the level derived by applying the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC Guidelines). This increase |  representing 23 per cent of the total emissions of the base year excluding land-use change and forestry |  was only applied to the years 1990 and 1991 and not to all subsequent years of the inventory as a consistent time series; (e) The SBSTA noted that Croatia made available to the SBSTA at its seventeenth session additional technical material in support of its claim for flexibility under Article 4 |  paragraph 6; (f) The SBSTA noted that the IPCC Guidelines include neither methodologies for changing or adjusting the emission estimates calculated using the IPCC Guidelines nor methodological guidance relating to time series. The IPCC Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC good practice guidance) requires |  in chapter 7.3.2 |  page 7.18 |  that emission estimates should be estimated consistently. All Annex I Parties are required to apply the IPCC good practice guidance when preparing inventories under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol; (g) The SBSTA noted that the guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention |  part I: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories |  state that the inventories of an entire time series |  including the base year and all subsequent years for which inventories have been reported |  should be estimated using the same methodologies and that the underlying activity data and emission factors should be obtained in a consistent manner (FCCC/CP/1997/7 |  decision 3/CP.5 |  para. 10); (h) The SBSTA concluded that |  from a methodological perspective |  the procedure used by Croatia to estimate its base year emissions is neither consistent with the IPCC good practice guidance nor consistent with the UNFCCC reporting guidelines contained in decision 3/CP.5; (i) The SBSTA agreed to forward these conclusions to the SBI at its seventeenth session |  in accordance with the conclusions of the SBSTA at its sixteenth session (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/6 |  para. 58 (c)). V. DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES (Agenda item 5) 1. Proceedings 34. The SBSTA considered this item at its 2nd and 7th meetings |  on 23 and 29 October |  respectively.

It encouraged the IEA/CTI |  UNDP–GEF |  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and other organizations to continue to provide assistance to developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition for their technology needs assessments and workshops. It further encouraged the IEA/CTI and other organizations to organize the remaining workshops contained in the EGTT programme of work |  giving special attention to small island developing States and the least developed countries; (f) The SBSTA encouraged the organizers of the workshops to engage the private sector |  where possible |  and to provide assessments of the workshops to the EGTT |  including the lessons learned; (g) The SBSTA noted the progress of work on TT:CLEAR and requested the secretariat to continue its work |  including exploring appropriate links with other networks. It invited UNEP to collaborate further with the secretariat in establishing a link between TT:CLEAR and the Sustainable Alternatives Network (SANet) |  including the latter’s function of ‘matchmaking’ between persons and/or organizations interested in the transfer of environmentally sound technologies. It further invited UNEP to present to the EGTT |  at its third meeting |  an update on the status of the GEF-funded UNEP project on |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2002/13 English Page 15 SANet activities and on the possible contributions this project can make to the current programme of work of the EGTT; (h) The SBSTA |  through the SBI |  invited the GEF to prepare a report synthesizing the lessons learned on the development and transfer of technologies based on its projects relating to climate change |  and to make it available to the EGTT as an input to its future work; (i) The SBSTA requested the SBI |  at its seventeenth session |  to consider the special needs relating to technology transfer activities when recommending to the COP a decision on the financial mechanism; (j) The SBSTA requested the secretariat |  resources permitting: (i) To prepare a technical paper outlining experiences |  lessons learned |  success stories and challenges in building the capacity of developing country Parties |  and Parties with economies in transition |  in the development and transfer of technologies. The paper should also identify possible prioritized capacitybuilding activities relating to the development and transfer of technologies; To prepare a technical paper on enabling environments for technology transfer on the basis of terms of reference recommended by the EGTT |  for consideration by the EGTT at its third meeting; To organize a workshop on enabling environments for technology transfer in April 2003 |  with the aim of facilitating an exchange of views and experiences to promote enabling environments |  and to report on the findings of the workshop to the SBSTA at its eighteenth session; |  |  |  | (ii) |  |  |  | (iii) |  |  |  | (k) The SBSTA welcomed the offer of the Government of Belgium to host the workshop on enabling environments for technology transfer under the Convention |  mentioned in paragraph 36 (j) (iii) above. The SBSTA noted the financial contribution of the Government of Finland |  and invited other Parties in a position to do so to provide funding |  and to ensure the widest possible participation of experts from developing country Parties; (l) The SBSTA recommended a draft decision on this subject (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.29/Add.1) for adoption by the COP at its eighth session.7 VI.

APPLICABILITY 1. The application of these provisions is mandatory |  except for those expressed in non-mandatory language. Parties’ implementation of national system requirements may differ according to national circumstances |  but shall include the elements described in these guidelines. Any differences in implementation shall not impair the performance of the functions described in these guidelines. II. DEFINITIONS A. Definition of national system 2. A national system includes all institutional |  legal and procedural arrangements made within a Party included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Party) for estimating anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol |  and for reporting and archiving inventory information. B. Other definitions 3. The meaning of the following terms in these guidelines for national systems2 is the same as in the glossary of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) good practice guidance | 3 accepted by the IPCC at its XVI Plenary:4 |  |  |  | 1 |  |  |  | All articles referred to in these guidelines are those of the Kyoto Protocol. For the sake of brevity |  the Kyoto Protocol is not specified after each article. The guidelines for national systems for the estimation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks under Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol are referred to as “guidelines for national systems” in this document. |  |  |  | 2 |  |  |  | 3 |  |  |  | The IPCC “Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories” is referred to as the “IPCC good practice guidance” in these guidelines for national systems. Montreal |  1-8 May 2000. |  |  |  | 4 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2000/5 English Page 26 (a) Good practice is a set of procedures intended to ensure that greenhouse gas inventories are accurate in the sense that they are systematically neither over- nor underestimated as far as can be judged |  and that uncertainties are reduced as far as possible. Good practice covers choice of estimation methods appropriate to national circumstances |  quality assurance and quality control at the national level |  quantification of uncertainties |  and data archiving and reporting to promote transparency; (b) Quality control (QC) is a system of routine technical activities to measure and control the quality of the inventory as it is being developed. The QC system is designed to: (i) (ii) (iii) Provide routine and consistent checks to ensure data integrity |  correctness and completeness; Identify and address errors and omissions; Document and archive inventory material and record all QC activities. |  |  |  | QC activities include general methods such as accuracy checks on data acquisition and calculations and the use of approved standardized procedures for emission calculations |  measurements |  estimating uncertainties |  archiving information and reporting. Higher tier QC activities also include technical reviews of source categories |  activity and emission factor data and methods; (c) Quality assurance (QA) activities include a planned system of review procedures conducted by personnel not directly involved in the inventory compilation development process |  to verify that data quality objectives were met |  ensure that the inventory represents the best possible estimate of emissions and sinks given the current state of scientific knowledge and data available |  and support the effectiveness of the QC programme; (d) Key source category is one that is prioritized within the national inventory because its estimate has a significant influence on a country’s total inventory of direct greenhouse gases in terms of the absolute level of emissions |  the trend in emissions |  or both; (e) Decision tree is a flow-chart describing the specific ordered steps which need to be followed to develop an inventory or an inventory component in accordance with the principles of good practice. 4. Recalculation |  consistent with the UNFCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories | 5 is a procedure for re-estimating anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG)6 emissions by sources and |  |  |  | 5 |  |  |  | FCCC/CP/1999/7. |  |  |  | 6 |  |  |  | References to greenhouse gases (GHGs) in these guidelines for national systems refer to GHGs not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2000/5 English Page 27 removals by sinks of previously submitted inventories7 as a consequence of changes in methodologies |  changes in the manner in which emission factors and activity data are obtained and used |  or the inclusion of new source and sink categories. III. OBJECTIVES 5. The objectives of national systems under Article 5.1 for the estimation of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol |  referred to below as national systems |  are: (a) To enable Annex I Parties to estimate anthropogenic GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks |  as required by Article 5 |  and to report these emissions by sources and removals by sinks in accordance with Article 7.1 and relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties (COP) and/or the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP); (b) and 7; (c) To facilitate the review of the information submitted under Article 7 by Annex I Parties |  as required by Article 8; (d) To assist Annex I Parties to ensure and improve the quality of their inventories. IV. CHARACTERISTICS 6. National systems should be designed and operated to ensure the transparency |  consistency |  comparability |  completeness and accuracy of inventories as defined in the guidelines for the preparation of inventories by Annex I Parties |  in accordance with relevant decisions of the COP and/or COP/MOP. 7. National systems should be designed and operated to ensure the quality of the inventory through planning |  preparation and management of inventory activities. Inventory activities include collecting activity data |  selecting methods and emission factors appropriately |  estimating anthropogenic GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks |  implementing uncertainty assessment and quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) activities |  and carrying out procedures for the verification of the inventory data at the national level |  as described in these guidelines for national systems. To assist Annex I Parties in meeting their commitments under Articles 3 |  |  |  | 7 |  |  |  | “National GHG inventories” are referred to simply as “inventories” in these guidelines for the sake of brevity. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2000/5 English Page 28 8. National systems should be designed and operated to support compliance with Kyoto Protocol commitments related to the estimation of anthropogenic GHG emissions by sources and removals by sinks. 9. National systems should be designed and operated to enable Annex I Parties to consistently estimate anthropogenic emissions by all sources and removals by all sinks of all GHGs |  as covered by the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and IPCC good practice guidance |  in accordance with relevant decisions of the COP and/or COP/MOP.

This information shall also include internal documentation on QA/QC procedures |  external and internal reviews |  documentation on annual key sources and key source identification and planned inventory improvements; (b) Provide review teams under Article 8 with access to all archived information used by the Party to prepare the inventory |  in accordance with relevant decisions of the COP and/or COP/MOP; (c) Respond to requests for clarifying inventory information resulting from the different stages of the review process of the inventory information |  and information on the national system |  in a timely manner in accordance with Article 8. 17. As part of its inventory management |  each Annex I Party should make the archived information accessible by collecting and gathering it at a single location. VII. ADOPTION AND UPDATING OF THE GUIDELINES 18. These guidelines for national systems shall be adopted |  reviewed and revised |  as appropriate |  according to the decisions of the COP/MOP |  taking into account any relevant decisions of the COP. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2000/5 English Page 32 Annex II FORMATS FOR THE SUBMISSION DUE ON 1 AUGUST 2000 OF PRELIMINARY |  COUNTRY-SPECIFIC DATA AND INFORMATION BY ANNEX I PARTIES FOR PROPOSALS RELATED TO ARTICLE 3.3 AND 3.4 OF THE KYOTO PROTOCOL This annex provides formats for the submission due on 1 August 2000 of preliminary |  country-specific data and information on proposals by Annex I Parties for activities related to Article 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. These formats |  together with any rules |  modalities or guidelines adopted for this annex |  or the data and information that will be submitted by Parties using this annex |  by no means prejudge decisions or conclusions that may be made by either the Conference of the Parties (COP) or the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) at future sessions. The terms and abbreviations used throughout this annex refer to the definitions given in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Land-Use |  Land-Use Change and Forestry in table 3-1 |  on pages 130-131 (definitional scenarios) and the section “Land-Based versus Activity-Based Accounting” on pages 130-131 (accounting approaches). For example |  the abbreviation “FAO” refers to a definitional scenario where: “A forest refers to a land that has |  or will have because of continued growth |  more than 10% canopy cover; deforestation is a decline of canopy cover to below 10% |  but excludes changes within the forest class; reforestation is artificial establishment of forest on lands that had them previously (including regeneration post-harvest); afforestation is artificial establishment of forest on lands that were not historically forest.” When completing the annex |  Parties may modify the definitional scenarios or accounting approaches or use country-specific definitions or approaches. In such cases where the definitions or approaches deviate from those provided by the IPCC Special Report |  this should be clearly stated and the applied definitions and/or approaches must be explained in the explanatory text that must accompany each table. In its submission the Annex I Party should complete those portions of tables I and III that directly relate to its preferred proposals. Furthermore |  the Annex I Parties may provide data and information in relation to other options using tables I and III. |  |  |  | Table I - Preliminary data and information provided by Annex I Party on carbon stock changes and areas related to Article 3.3 activities |  | Article 3.3 Country specific data Definitions Accounting framework aII CII acp Ccp aI CI (ha) (t C) (ha) (t C) (ha) (t C) Methods and approaches Data sources |  data quality |  and uncertainty (e.g. ranges) Other information relevant to decision-making |  |  |  | Afforestation IPCC Reforestation Afforestation FAO |  |  |  | Activity based Land based Activity based Land based Reforestation FAO Activity based Land based I Land based II Afforestation Other Activity based Reforestation Land based Deforestation IPCC/FAO Activity based Land based Other Activity based Land based Area (ha) afforested and reforested |  or deforested since 1990 up to 1995 or possibly an earlier specific year.

Opening of the session |  | (Agenda item 1) 1. The twenty-sixth session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) was held at the Maritim hotel in Bonn |  Germany |  from 7 to 18 May 2007. 2. The Chair of the SBSTA |  Mr. Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) |  opened the session and welcomed all Parties and observers. He also welcomed Ms. Ermira Fida (Albania) as Vice-Chair of the SBSTA. 3. The Chair invited the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC |  Mr. Yvo de Boer |  to address the SBSTA. The Executive Secretary used the occasion to highlight key policy issues on the provisional agenda of the SBSTA at its twenty-sixth session and expressed the hope that the SBSTA would also make progress on the other important items on its agenda. 4. Noting that the implementation of the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change had successfully started |  the Executive Secretary stated that the SBSTA would receive its first update from the secretariat on the progress made so far |  as well as on further planned activities |  under the relevant agenda item. 5. The Executive Secretary expressed the hope that at this session and prior to the twenty-seventh session of the SBSTA |  Parties would want to overcome their differences and come to conclusions on the review of the Expert Group of Technology Transfer (EGTT) and the framework for meaningful and effective actions to enhance the implementation of Article 4 |  paragraph 5 |  of the Convention (technology transfer framework) so that a decision could be taken on this matter at the thirteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP). 6. The Executive Secretary stated that since the initiation of discussions on reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries at COP 11 in Montreal and after two workshops on this issue |  Parties had developed a better understanding of the technical |  policy and financing challenges surrounding this matter. He expressed the hope that the SBSTA |  at its twenty-sixth session |  could substantially advance the work on reducing emissions from deforestation and fulfil the mandate1 provided by the Conference of the Parties at its eleventh session. 7. The Executive Secretary highlighted the importance of a broad and active cooperation with relevant international organizations and United Nations bodies in order to foster real action on the ground regarding climate change. He noted that the secretariat had established channels of communication with all other United Nations bodies and relevant international organizations. He indicated that during this session Parties would have the opportunity to receive information on actions taken by the international organizations and United Nations bodies either in response to Parties’ requests or as their own initiatives and how these actions were of relevance to the work within the UNFCCC. |  |  |  | 1 |  |  |  | FCCC/CP/2005/5 |  paragraph 83. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2007/4 Page 4 |  |  |  | II.

The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 1st meeting |  on 7 May |  at which the Chair proposed the programme of work. The SBSTA agreed to proceed on the basis of the Chair’s proposal. The secretariat informed the SBSTA of the status of documentation. Statements were made by representatives of five Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China |  one on behalf of the least developed countries |  one on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) |  one on behalf of the Umbrella Group and one on behalf of the African Group. 11. The secretariat informed the SBSTA that applications for provisional accreditation to the sessions of the subsidiary bodies had been received from 11 non-governmental organizations. The SBSTA agreed to admit these organizations |  on the basis of provisions of Article 7 |  paragraph 6 |  of the Convention |  without prejudice to subsequent action by the COP. 12. At the 4th meeting |  on 18 May |  the Chair informed the SBSTA that |  during the session |  a meeting was organized for the Chair of the SBSTA and the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) with the chairs of the expert groups established under the Convention (the Consultative Group of Experts on national communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (CGE) |  the EGTT and the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG)). The aim of this meeting |  in which the Executive Secretary also participated |  was threefold |  namely to exchange information on the status of each group’s work programme |  to exchange information on collaboration among the expert groups to date and consider recommendations for further collaboration |  and to consider the contribution of the groups to the Nairobi work programme. 13. The Chair reported that good progress had been made so far by the three groups in enhancing collaboration among themselves. Expert groups were commonly invited to attend meetings of other expert groups and this practice was expected to be continued in the future. In addition |  expert groups were regularly given the opportunity to comment on each other’s outputs |  such as training materials. The SBI and SBSTA Chairs were pleased to note that collaboration among the expert groups had become a good practice in the implementation of each group’s work programme and hoped this collaboration would continue and even be enhanced in the coming years. 14. The Chair noted that the expert groups were keen to contribute to the Nairobi work programme. The first step would be to participate in the related workshops and consider relevant parts of the synthesis report on adaptation planning and practices |  which would be prepared for the SBSTA at its twenty-seventh session (December 2007). 15. The Chair concluded that during the meeting the Chairs of the three expert groups had clearly indicated that the groups were facing critical common challenges. Noting that the EGTT was working with Parties on technology needs assessments (TNAs) |  with the LEG on national adaptation plans of action (NAPAs) and with the CGE on national communications of Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (non-Annex I Parties) |  the Chair stated that Parties were now reaching the stage where the outcomes of this work need to be implemented. The question now was how to transform good ideas from TNAs |  NAPAs and national communications into project proposals that would meet the international standards of financial providers.

The purpose of the recommendations presented in the annex is to identify specific actions for enhancing the implementation of the framework for meaningful and effective actions to enhance the implementation of Article 4 |  paragraph 5 |  of the Convention (referred to hereinafter as the technology transfer framework) |  as requested by decision 6/CP.10. 2. These recommendations were developed taking into account: (a) Experience and lessons learned from the implementation of the technology transfer framework since its adoption by the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its seventh session (decision 4/CP.7); Progress of the work and the activities completed since the inception of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) in 2001 and the outcomes of its deliberations; Relevant ongoing activities relating to the development and transfer of technologies of various national |  regional and international organizations |  governments and the private sector |  in different forums; That the work on advancing the uptake of mitigation technologies and technologies for adaptation to climate change involves cross-cutting activities and |  as such |  normally is implemented under multiple key themes of the framework; The need to promote a broader involvement of Parties |  international organizations |  the private sector (in particular business and industry as well as the financial community) |  technology practitioners and other relevant stakeholders for the implementation of the framework; The need to strike a balance between strategic and operational actions |  whereby the strategic actions are implemented by organizing technical workshops and expert meetings. These lead to the preparation of reports |  technical papers and other tools on specific issues that provide technical inputs and operational guidance for the benefit of Parties and other users. |  |  |  | (b) (c) |  |  |  | (d) |  |  |  | (e) |  |  |  | (f) |  |  |  | 3. The existing structure |  five thematic areas of work |  definitions and purpose under the current technology transfer framework contained in the annex to decision 4/CP.7 continue to provide a solid basis for implementing the provisions of the Article 4 |  paragraph 5 |  of the Convention. 4. Given that technology is one of the important elements for discussions on the future long-term cooperative actions to address climate change by enhancing implementation of the Convention |  the suggested time frame for the implementation of the actions outlined below is for the medium term covering the period between 2007 and 2012 or until the eighteenth session of the COP (2012). These recommendations address the medium-term work |  pending the results of the Dialogue on long-term cooperative actions on climate change by enhancing implementation of the Convention (Dialogue). |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2007/4 Page 22 5. The implementation of the recommendations presented below should be considered as further actions for enhancing the implementation of Article 4 |  paragraph 5 |  of the Convention set out in the technology transfer framework. 6. Work developed under each key theme has evolved to a more practical and results-oriented level and should continue to do so by promoting actions in specific sectors and regions. Therefore |  there is a need to undertake periodic review on implementation of the framework and its effectiveness. 7. The EGTT recognized the need for financial and technical support to enable the Parties not included in the Annex I to the Convention (non-Annex I Parties) to implement the recommended actions below. In this regard Parties |  when considering these recommendations |  may wish to consider ways and means to address these needs. A. Technology needs and needs assessments 8. Most of the actions described in paragraph 7 of the technology transfer framework under the theme of technology needs assessments (TNAs) have been completed as described in paragraphs 16–21 of the main part of document FCCC/SBSTA/2006/INF.4. Based on lessons learned in the implementation of this theme |  the following recommendations are made to enhance the implementation of this key theme: (a) To encourage non-Annex I Parties that have not yet undertaken or completed their TNAs |  to do so as soon as possible |  and to make these reports available to the secretariat for posting on the UNFCCC technology information clearing house (TT:CLEAR); To encourage non-Annex I Parties to provide updated information on their technology needs in their second national communications and other national reports and to make them available to the secretariat; To request the secretariat to prepare a synthesis report(s) of the information mentioned in paragraph 8 (a) and (b) above for consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA); To request the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and its implementing agencies |  other intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) |  international financial institutions (IFIs) |  Climate Technology Initiative (CTI) and Parties that are in a position to do so to provide capacity-building for non-Annex I Parties to conduct |  report and use TNAs; To request that |  not later than 2009: (i) The secretariat |  in collaboration with the EGTT |  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and CTI |  update the handbook for conducting technology needs assessments before SBSTA 28 |  taking into account experience and lessons learned indicated in the synthesis report on technology needs prepared by the secretariat | 1 cross-referencing the work on innovative financing and technologies for adaptation |  and widely disseminate the updated handbook to Parties through TT:CLEAR and other means in different United Nations official languages; The EGTT |  with the assistance of the secretariat |  prepare a report on good practices for conducting TNAs in collaboration with UNDP |  UNEP and CTI for |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | (d) |  |  |  | (e) |  |  |  | (ii) |  |  |  | 1 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2006/INF.1. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/2007/4 Page 23 consideration by the SBSTA |  and disseminate it to relevant stakeholders and practitioners; (f) To make available the results of TNAs |  related experience and lessons learned in the TNA process and sharing them at national and international levels through the network of technology information centres |  including through the organization of workshops by the secretariat in collaboration with relevant international organizations and initiatives; The secretariat to provide regular updates on progress of the implementation of the results of technology needs identified in TNAs |  including success stories for consideration by the SBSTA at its subsequent sessions |  as appropriate; To invite the EGTT to cooperate closely with the other expert groups constituted under the Convention |  especially the CGE |  with the aim of coordinating activities relating to TNAs and national communications. |  |  |  | (g) |  |  |  | (h) |  |  |  | 9.

OPENING OF THE SESSION (Agenda item 1) 1. The eighth session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) was held at the Hotel Maritim |  Bonn |  from 2 to 12 June 1998. 2. The Chairman of the SBSTA |  Mr. Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia) |  opened the session on 2 June 1998. He welcomed all delegates and observers and wished the participants a successful session. The Chairman noted that this was the first session of the SBSTA since the Conference of the Parties (COP) |  at its third session |  had adopted the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Chairman remarked that all delegates should feel pride in that achievement and expressed the hope that the momentum of work thus generated would be maintained. Observing that this was the only occasion on which the SBSTA would meet before the fourth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 4) |  the Chairman urged all Parties to seek common ground and prepare recommendations for decisions to be adopted at COP 4. The extended meeting time available to the SBSTA at this session should facilitate such progress. He concluded by encouraging Parties to make the best use of the time available to them. 3. At the 1st meeting |  on 2 June |  the Executive Secretary also welcomed all participants to the session. He noted that |  whilst certain items on the SBSTA provisional agenda could be dealt with quickly |  others |  such as items 6 (b) and 8 |  would probably require more time. In this context |  the Executive Secretary emphasized the need for flexibility so as to allow the necessary sequencing and coordination between the two subsidiary bodies in the consideration of agenda items. 4. At the 2nd meeting |  which was held jointly with the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) on 2 June |  statements were made by Her Excellency María Julia Alsogaray |  Secretary of Natural Resources and Sustainable Development |  Argentina |  Mr. Klaus Töpfer |  Executive Director |  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Executive Secretary. 5. Her Excellency María Julia Alsogaray emphasized the need for COP 4 to maintain the  spirit of Kyoto  and to make progress in rendering the Kyoto Protocol operational. Minister Alsogaray emphasized that the government of Argentina would |  as host government of COP 4 |  be doing its utmost to promote such progress. As an example of an area where particular progress might be made |  she identified broad interest in the early functioning of the clean development mechanism |  as well as in emissions trading. She noted that accounting and verification underlie both these issues and that developing procedures and mechanisms for compliance will also become critical. In closing |  Minister Alsogaray called upon all Parties to help identify achievable priorities to enable COP 4 to advance the work begun at Kyoto. 6. Mr. Klaus Töpfer reminded delegates that 5 June was World Environment Day. The occasion was a reminder of the need to decouple economic growth from environmental pollution. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1998/6 English Page 5 Flexible economic instruments could help to attain this goal at lowest cost by ensuring that  prices tell the environmental truth . Mr. Töpfer underscored the need for close cooperation between institutions in the United Nations family |  and outlined the means by which UNEP |  in cooperation with the conferences of the parties to the  Rio conventions  |  might aid in the achievement of common environmental goals. He identified the need for a better scientific assessment of the linkages between the conventions and of possible synergies in their programmes |  for example |  with respect to the crosscutting environmental demands posed by hydrofluorocarbon gases (HFCs). UNEP also looked forward to cooperating with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) with the aim of promoting an intergovernmental process on the use of economic instruments for the effective implementation of environmental policy. In closing |  Mr. Töpfer emphasized the need for all institutions to work together to meet common goals. 7. The Executive Secretary began by thanking Minister Alsogaray and Mr. Töpfer for their statements. With particular reference to Mr. Töpfer s remarks |  the Executive Secretary underlined the importance of building on the potential for policy coherence and positive linkages among different conventions. In this context |  he recalled his suggestion to the COP Bureau that the SBSTA might consider inviting UNEP to address issues relating to HFCs and to land-use change and forestry which cut across the Kyoto Protocol and other legal instruments. The Executive Secretary then offered some comments regarding work on the mechanisms envisaged in Articles 6 |  12 and 17 of the Kyoto Protocol. Firstly |  he observed that |  since Kyoto |  a multiplicity of activities on the mechanisms had been initiated by various organizations. He informed the subsidiary bodies that the secretariat had recently convened a meeting of a number of such organizations to exchange information on their activities. The information collected could be found in documents FCCC/SB/1998/MISC.2 and Add.1. Secondly |  the Executive Secretary turned to the secretariat work programme with respect to the mechanisms |  noting that |  to date |  this had centred around methodological issues relating to the pilot phase of activities implemented jointly. He suggested that this work could be adapted to the needs of the new mechanisms |  in particular joint implementation (Article 6) and the clean development mechanism (Article 12) and |  in this context |  he drew the attention of Parties to the note by the secretariat contained in document FCCC/SB/1998/2. In particular |  the Executive Secretary proposed that the secretariat could make inputs to the design of modalities for certification under these two articles |  both of project activities and of emission reductions |  as appropriate |  as well as to the architecture of governance. He noted that such functions should be kept separate from the promotion and finance of projects; therefore |  the secretariat should not be involved in such work as the design of financial mechanisms |  arrangements for the preparation of projects or investment clearing houses. The Executive Secretary further underscored the potential contribution of the secretariat to work on related elements of the Kyoto Protocol |  such as guidelines for national systems |  the accounting of assigned amounts and compliance |  observing that the credibility of the Kyoto Protocol would depend on the effectiveness of these procedures. The Executive Secretary concluded by noting that he looked forward to guidance from Parties on the work programme of the secretariat |  in the light of his comments. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1998/6 English Page 6 II.

At the 4th meeting |  the Chairman informed the SBSTA that he was conducting consultations with the regional groups on this matter |  in close cooperation with the Chairman of the SBI. 13. At the 12th meeting |  the Chairman reported with regret that |  despite his best efforts |  it had not proved possible to reach consensus among the regional groups and elect the remaining officers of the SBSTA. He expressed the hope that the regional groups would consult among themselves prior to COP 4 so that the officers of the SBSTA could be elected expeditiously at that time. C. Organization of the work of the session (Agenda item 2 (c)) 14. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 4th meeting |  on 3 June. It had before it document FCCC/SB/1998/3. |  |  |  | 2 |  |  |  | This sub-item relates to Article 6 of the Kyoto Protocol and paragraph 5 (c) of decision 1/CP.3. The term “joint implementation” is used for convenience. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1998/6 English Page 8 15. The Chairman drew the attention of the SBSTA to the tentative schedule of meetings contained in document FCCC/SB/1998/3 |  noting that the schedule was intended to be used as a guide |  and might need to be modified to reflect the pace of progress. 16. The Chairman informed the SBSTA that applications for accreditation to the sessions of the subsidiary bodies had recently been received from nine non-governmental organizations. These applications had been screened by the secretariat on the basis of the provisions of Article 7.6 of the Convention and in accordance with the procedures established by the COP for the admission of organizations as observers.

At its 13th meeting |  having considered a proposal by the Chairman |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA noted with appreciation the information provided by the secretariat on its cooperation with international organizations. It agreed to invite more international |  |  |  | 3 |  |  |  | For the full list of participants |  see document FCCC/1998/INF.1. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1998/6 English Page 10 organizations |  including the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization to make progress on their work relevant to the Convention and to provide reports to the SBSTA; (b) The SBSTA took note of the activities of the IPCC relating to the Convention. In particular |  it noted with appreciation the work initiated in the preparation of special reports on emission scenarios |  methodological and technical issues in technology transfer and aviation and the global atmosphere |  as well as the preparation of the Third Assessment Report. The SBSTA invited the IPCC to take into account the comments made by Parties on the structure and contents of the Third Assessment Report |  as contained in documents FCCC/SBSTA/1997/MISC.4 and FCCC/SBSTA/1998/MISC.1 |  when considering the scope of this report; (c) The SBSTA noted with appreciation the information provided by the representative of the WMO (see paragraph 24 above) |  on behalf of the organizations participating in the Climate Agenda |  related to the preparation of the comprehensive report on the development of the observational networks of the climate system |  as requested by decision 8/CP.3. The SBSTA recognized the deteriorating situation of the observational networks of the climate system and urged Parties to give high priority to reversing this decline and to introducing improvements. It invited the organizations participating in the Climate Agenda to complete the comprehensive report and to make it available for consideration by the SBSTA at its ninth session; (d) The SBSTA took note of the report presented by the Executive Director of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (see paragraph 24 above). It expressed appreciation for the information and suggested that the IGBP should continue to make available relevant information for its use in the future; (e) The SBSTA noted the statement made by the Executive Director of UNEP at its 2 meeting |  held jointly with the SBI on 2 June (see paragraph 6 above) |  on the role of UNEP as set out in the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 of the nineteenth special session of the United Nations General Assembly |  including paragraphs 119 and 123 (General Assembly S-19/2). The SBSTA observed that this role is to be carried out in a manner consistent with the provisions of the respective conventions and the decisions of their conferences of the parties and in full cooperation with the conferences of the parties; |  | nd |  |  |  | (f) The SBSTA further noted the statements made by the Executive Director of UNEP and the Executive Secretary at that same joint meeting (see paragraphs 6 and 7 above) with regard to possible inputs by UNEP to the work of the Convention bodies on the implementation of the Convention and on preparations for the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. It recalled that decisions on such inputs are the prerogative of the Conference of the parties and its subsidiary bodies in accordance with the Convention and the decisions of the COP. The SBSTA would welcome such inputs in response to specific requests from the COP |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1998/6 English Page 11 and its subsidiary bodies for scientific and technical advice. The SBSTA invited the Executive Director of UNEP to consult the Chairman of the IPCC and the Executive Secretary in responding to any such requests; (g) The SBSTA noted that the programme of work of the IPCC would provide the Convention process with scientific |  technical and economic advice and other material on a number of matters directly relevant to the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol (including the use of economic instruments) |  as well as on matters that cut across these climate change instruments and other legal instruments such as the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer and its Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer |  the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention to Combat Desertification. Such information from the IPCC would be contained in its Third Assessment Report |  and other reports |  including reports requested by the SBSTA. The SBSTA considered that such reports would be useful for the foreseeable scientific and technical needs of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol in these areas; (h) The SBSTA welcomed the readiness of UNEP to strengthen its efforts to raise awareness about climate change |  the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol |  in response to Article 6 of the Convention. It noted that this work would be carried out in close collaboration with the secretariat and other United Nations bodies |  and would draw upon IPCC outputs. It requested the Executive Secretary to keep it informed of progress achieved. The SBSTA decided to review its cooperation with UNEP at its tenth session; (i) The SBSTA encouraged the secretariat to continue |  maintain and strengthen its coordination and collaboration with relevant international organizations. IV. NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS (Agenda item 4) A. Communications from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Agenda item 4 (a)) 1. Proceedings 28.

Conclusions 30. At its 10th meeting |  on 11 June |  having considered a proposal by the Chairman |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA requested the secretariat to send a questionnaire to Parties on clarifications |  additions and/or amendments to the revised guidelines for the preparation of national communications from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (UNFCCC Guidelines) by 31 August 1998. The SBSTA also decided that the preparatory work needed to enable the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP) to adopt |  at its first session |  guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7 of the Protocol would be integrated |  to the extent practicable |  with its existing work under the Convention on national communications from Annex I Parties; (b) The SBSTA requested Parties to provide submissions to the secretariat answering the above-mentioned questionnaire by 1 February 1999 for compilation into a miscellaneous document; (c) The SBSTA requested the secretariat to organize a workshop with the participation of representatives from Parties to assess the responses to the questionnaire. The SBSTA further requested the secretariat to prepare a paper on the results of this workshop for consideration at its tenth session |  with the aim of proposing any necessary clarifications |  additions and/or amendments to the UNFCCC Guidelines |  at the fifth session of the Conference of the Parties. B. Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention: methodological aspects of consideration process (Agenda item 4 (b)) 31. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 4th meeting |  on 3 June. Statements were made by representatives of three Parties. 32. The SBSTA noted that |  as indicated in the annotations to the provisional agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/1 |  paras. 23-25) |  in view of the agreed division of labour |  this item would be discussed by the SBI. Since there were no methodological issues under this sub-item that needed to be addressed at the current session |  there was |  therefore |  no need for an input from the SBSTA. 33. The SBSTA further noted |  however |  that it would examine any methodological issues arising from the consideration of this item by the SBI at a future session. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1998/6 English Page 13 V.

The SBSTA noted that education |  training and public awareness were priorities for many Parties and that international cooperation could play an important role in these areas. It further considered that national efforts to achieve the aims of Article 6 should be supported; (b) The SBSTA took note of the results of a workshop on this issue held on 9 June that had been jointly organized by the secretariat and UNEP and chaired by the Chairman of the SBSTA. In particular |  the SBSTA noted the efforts to assess public awareness needs in developing countries |  as presented at the workshop. The SBSTA expressed satisfaction with this initiative and called for similar events in the future; (c) The SBSTA also took note with interest of the statement by the representative of UNEP who outlined the activities of that organization in raising awareness of climate change issues |  many of which are conducted in cooperation with the secretariat. The SBSTA indicated its interest in activities by United Nations organizations and bodies |  especially UNEP |  for supporting international cooperation and national outreach activities |  and requested further information to be provided at its next session. The SBSTA also noted and welcomed the information outreach activities of the secretariat |  and encouraged it to continue with this work; |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1998/6 English Page 14 (d) The SBSTA noted that the following measures cited by Parties could be considered as possible means of promoting common efforts towards the implementation of Article 6: (i) Increasing the availability of public information and education materials |  including the reports of the IPCC |  in all the official languages of the United Nations |  as well as in other languages; Promoting the exchange of copyright-free materials |  the facilitation of training and the sharing of experience |  for example |  through a resource centre; Establishing training activities in developing countries through CC:TRAIN and other appropriate programmes; Facilitating the exchange or secondment of personnel to train experts in the field of climate change; Assisting developing countries in procuring financial resources for their implementation of Article 6; and Ensuring the availability of information about all aspects of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol |  including information on the mechanisms defined in the Kyoto Protocol and other provisions for achieving its objective |  using CC:INFO and other appropriate mechanisms; |  |  |  | (ii) |  |  |  | (iii) (iv) (v) (vi) |  |  |  | (e) The SBSTA noted that funding was essential to the implementation of Article 6 and invited the SBI to consider this matter when developing further guidance to the financial mechanism of the Convention; (f) The SBSTA urged Parties to implement Article 6 at the national level and to pursue international cooperation to strengthen public awareness |  education |  and outreach programmes. It called for Parties to present fully their activities on Article 6 when submitting their national communications; (g) The SBSTA invited Parties to submit to the secretariat |  by 14 December 1998 |  their views on possible means of promoting the implementation of Article 6 |  for compilation into a miscellaneous document. The SBSTA invited the secretariat to put forward proposals on how to integrate Article 6 into the work programme of the SBSTA |  taking into account the above submissions from Parties |  for consideration at its tenth session. In this context |  the SBSTA also requested the secretariat to explore the development of more rigorous reporting guidelines on Article 6 for national communications |  and to present these to the SBSTA for its consideration; |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1998/6 English Page 15 (h) The SBSTA finally requested the secretariat to explore the possibility of establishing a United Nations “Climate Change Day” to promote awareness of climate change issues at the national and international levels. VI. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES (Agenda item 6) A. Emissions inventories (Agenda item 6 (a)) 1. Proceedings 38.

At its 10th meeting |  on 11 June |  having considered a proposal by the Chairman |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA took note of document FCCC/SBSTA/1998/4 |  and endorsed the activities related to greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories set out in that document; (b) The SBSTA urged Parties to participate actively in the ongoing activities of the current programme of work on methodologies related to GHG inventories |  bearing in mind their relationship with possible additions and/or amendments to the revised guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Annex I Parties |  discussed under agenda item 4 (a) |  and the longer-term methodological needs of the Kyoto Protocol |  inter alia |  the development of guidelines for national systems and adjustments under Article 5 of that Protocol; (c) The SBSTA recalled the relevant conclusions of its seventh session |  and requested Annex I Parties which had not already done so to make available to the secretariat |  by 15 August 1998 |  for purposes of comparison and transparency |  their complete 1996 GHG inventories obtained using |  when possible |  best available methodologies and those obtained using the current default methodologies of the IPCC Guidelines. It also requested Parties which had not already done so to submit to the secretariat |  by 15 August 1998 |  their views on possible approaches to resolving the methodological issues related to GHG inventories such as those identified in the annex on methodological issues contained in document FCCC/SBI/1997/19 |  for compilation into a miscellaneous document; |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1998/6 English Page 16 (d) The SBSTA requested the secretariat to organize a workshop with the participation of methodological experts from the roster |  as well as from other relevant organizations |  to develop proposals to resolve the methodological issues identified by Parties and by the secretariat while processing GHG inventories included in second national communications. The conclusions of such a workshop |  and of any workshop organized by the secretariat related to possible additions and/or amendments to the revised guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Annex I Parties (decision 9/CP.2) |  as discussed under agenda item 4 (a) |  should be available for the tenth session of the SBSTA; (e) The SBSTA noted that the Kyoto Protocol includes provisions related to GHG inventory methods. The SBSTA recognized that methodological issues arising from the Protocol including |  for example |  guidance for estimating and reporting HFCs |  perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride |  need to be evaluated. The SBSTA encouraged the IPCC-OECD-IEA Inventories Programme to give high priority to completing its work on uncertainty |  as well as to prepare a report on good practices in inventory management and to submit a report on these issues for consideration by the SBSTA |  if possible by COP 5. The SBSTA encouraged the secretariat to continue its close collaboration with other relevant bodies |  such as the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol |  on technical and methodological issues. B. Land-use change and forestry - decision 1/CP.3 |  paragraph 5 (a) (Agenda item 6 (b)) 1. Proceedings 41. The SBSTA considered this sub-item at its 5th and 12th meetings |  on 4 and 12 June |  respectively. It had before it documents FCCC/SBSTA/1998/INF.1 and FCCC/SB/1998/MISC.1. 42. Statements were made by representatives of 17 Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the African Group |  another speaking on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States and another speaking of behalf of the European Community and its member States. The representative of a non-governmental organization also made a statement. 43. At the 5th meeting on 4 June |  a statement was made by the representative of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). 44.

Conclusions 45. At its 12th meeting |  having considered a proposal by the Chairman on the basis of inputs from the informal contact group |  the SBSTA adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBSTA took note with appreciation of document FCCC/SBSTA/1998/INF.1 prepared by the secretariat; (b) The SBSTA understands the meaning of Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol to be as follows: The adjustment to a Party’s assigned amount shall be equal to verifiable changes in carbon stocks during the period 2008 to 2012 resulting from direct human-induced activities of afforestation |  reforestation and deforestation since 1 January 1990. Where the result of this calculation is a net sink |  this value shall be added to the Party’s assigned amount. Where the result of this calculation is a net emission |  this value shall be subtracted from the Party’s assigned amount; (c) The SBSTA invited Parties to submit information related to: (i) The implementation of Article 3.3 |  particularly on data and methods |  and questions and issues identified in FCCC/SBSTA/1998/INF.1 |  by 15 August 1998 for compilation into a miscellaneous document by approximately 30 August 1998; and Modalities |  rules and guidelines as to how and which additional humaninduced activities might be included under Article 3.4 |  including questions and issues identified in FCCC/SBSTA/1998/INF.1 |  by 1 October 1998 for compilation into a miscellaneous document by approximately 15 October 1998; |  |  |  | (ii) |  |  |  | (d) The SBSTA requested the secretariat to organize a workshop prior to COP 4 with participation by experts including those engaged in the IPCC process |  possibly coincident with an IPCC expert meeting. The purpose of the workshop would be to consider data availability based on definitions used by Parties and international organizations |  including their implications |  in relation to Article 3.3 and to consider any further inputs to the IPCC |  including to the report referred to in subparagraph (e) below. It also agreed to plan a second workshop after COP 4 to focus on issues arising from Article 3.4 and document FCCC/SBSTA/1998/INF.1 |  the comments submitted by Parties and issues arising from the first workshop. It requested the secretariat to report on the initial workshop at the ninth session of the SBSTA; (e) The SBSTA requested the IPCC to prepare and provide information to the SBSTA and the COP |  in particular a special report as defined by IPCC procedures |  on land-use |  land-use change and forestry |  in order to enable the COP to take decisions on recommendations on these issues to the COP/MOP at its first session. The special report should address the |  |  |  | FCCC/SBSTA/1998/6 English Page 18 methodological |  scientific and technical implications of the relevant articles of the Protocol |  particularly Article 3. The special report should consider the anthropogenic implications of full carbon stock accounting |  set the overall scientific context for consideration of land-use |  land-use change and forestry activities |  and consider the initial list of scientific and technical questions contained in FCCC/SBSTA/1998/INF.1 as well as comments to be provided by the Parties to the secretariat by 15 August 1998; (f) The SBSTA requested the IPCC to examine |  to the extent possible |  the scientific and technical implications of carbon sequestration strategies related to land-use |  land-use change and forestry activities for water |  soils |  biodiversity |  and other environmental and socio-economic effects |  to be included in the special report as appropriate. Other issues not covered in the special report could be included in the Third Assessment Report and in any other relevant IPCC products; (g) The SBSTA requested the secretariat to liaise with the secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity |  the secretariat of the Convention to Combat Desertification |  the Intergovernmental Forum on Forests |  the FAO and other international bodies and organizations to ensure that relevant information is available to the Parties.
