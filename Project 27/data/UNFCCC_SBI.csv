At its 8th meeting |  on 10 December |  having considered a proposal by the Chair |  the SBI adopted the following conclusions:2 (a) The SBI took note of the report by the CGE on its first meeting (FCCC/SBI/2003/INF.17) and expressed its gratitude to the Government of Mexico for hosting that meeting. (b) The SBI also took note of the work programme of the CGE for the period 2003–2007 including the hands-on training workshops on thematic areas of national communications of Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (non-Annex I Parties). The SBI noted that these workshops aim to provide technical advice to non-Annex I Parties and to assist them in the preparation of their second and |  where appropriate |  initial and third national communications. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the workshops |  the SBI requested the CGE and the secretariat |  when organizing regional workshops |  to seek to invite experts working on the different areas of national communications |  taking into account other relevant activities and programmes (such as the national adaptation programmes of action (NAPA) processes). The SBI acknowledged that the financial and technical resources available may not be sufficient for the amount of work that the CGE is mandated to do and that the CGE will need to take into account available resources in implementing its work programme. The SBI therefore invited Annex II Parties to contribute financial resources to support the organization of the workshops to be conducted by the CGE |  in accordance with paragraph 6 of decision 3/CP.8. (c) The SBI concluded that closer cooperation with expert groups established under the Convention – the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) and the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) – would be beneficial to the work of the CGE. The SBI encouraged the CGE |  in its work on supporting the process of preparation of national communications |  to take into account activities of the National Communications Support Programme (NCSP) of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) |  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The SBI further concluded that |  in the fulfilment of the mandate of the CGE |  it will be beneficial for the CGE |  in its efforts to facilitate support to non-Annex I Parties to meet their needs and concerns in the process of preparing national communications |  to receive regular reports from the NCSP. (d) The SBI emphasized the need for the CGE to prioritize its activities and/or tasks in operationalizing its work programme to support the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties.

(b) The SBI welcomed the progress made by non-Annex I Parties in the preparation of their national communications as reflected in the document on the “Status of the preparation of national communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention”.4 The SBI noted with satisfaction that 110 non-Annex I Parties had so far submitted their initial national communications |  and encouraged those Parties that have yet to submit their initial national communications to do so as soon as possible.

Concerning support for non-Annex I Parties  initial communications |  the Executive Secretary stated that Convention bodies were not well informed about the prospects for receipt of the national communications and that several non-Annex I Parties had announced delays in their completion. He further stated that the secretariat was convinced that there was an urgent need for a modest |  lightweight and responsive support arrangement for non-Annex I communications consisting of these elements: a concerted  marketing  effort to ensure that non-Annex I Parties have access to the financial resources they require to prepare their national communications; a central point for collecting information on the progress of communications projects |  providing a help-desk function and mobilizing rapid expert assistance; and a programme to enable groups of similar countries to exchange experiences as they prepare their initial communications. |  |  |  | II. |  |  |  | ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS (Agenda item 2) |  |  |  | A.

At its 6th meeting |  on 28 February |  having considered a proposal by its Vice-Chairman |  the SBI adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBI recalled decision 17/CP.2 of the COP at its second session |  whereby it requested the Executive Secretary to submit to the SBI |  at its fifth session |  further options for reducing the cost of documentation for the meetings of the COP and its subsidiary bodies. The SBI took note that the Executive Secretary required more time to prepare recommendations on this matter and would submit them to the SBI at its sixth session; (b) The SBI noted the concern of developing country Parties that the distribution of documents by conventional means be maintained |  since many delegates of those Parties did not yet have access to electronic communication media. It requested the secretariat to make provision for the adequate and timely distribution of documents to Parties in paper form; (c) In this connection |  the SBI also took note of the policy being applied by the United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG) |  in accordance with General Assembly resolution 36/117B |  of 10 December |  1981 |  not to distribute official documents until all language versions are ready for simultaneous distribution. In the light of this policy |  the SBI recommended that the agendas of the Convention bodies should |  as far as possible |  include only items for which the documents were expected to be available in advance in all the official languages. The SBI considered that there were some types of documents whose consideration could not be scheduled this way |  for example the annotated agendas and the reports of sessions of Convention bodies |  and the documentation of the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM); (d) In the light of these considerations |  the SBI requested the Executive Secretary to explore with the UNOG the possibility that |  when justified by exceptional circumstances |  as indicated above |  each language version of a document may be distributed by UNOG as it became available. |  |  |  | VII.

The SBI endorsed the elements contained in document FCCC/SBI/1997/4 as revised and reproduced below and requested the Executive Secretary to forward them to the special session on Agenda 21 of the United Nations General Assembly. 2. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) |  which was adopted in 1992 |  has received 165 instruments of ratification or accession assuring almost universal membership of States. 3. The Convention was one of the key outcomes of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) |  and its objectives have a close relationship to the goals of sustainable development. It has linkages to the framework of Agenda 21 |  with relation to energy |  transport |  industry |  agriculture |  forests |  water and waste management. 4. An important element in the global effort to address climate change and its impacts is the open exchange of information on the implementation of commitments of Parties under the Convention. This also contributes to developing international debate on longer-term trends in consumption and production patterns |  in accordance with Agenda 21. National communications are submitted so that Parties inform each other of how they are meeting their commitments under the Convention and describe their climate change programmes and how these programmes will affect greenhouse gas emissions and sinks by the year 2000. 5. In addition |  the UNFCCC secretariat is mandated by the Parties to the Convention to prepare a compilation and synthesis of the national communications for consideration by them. A second such compilation and synthesis was submitted to the second session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) in which it considered the national communications of 33 Annex I Parties. The document provides an overview of the implementation of the Convention by reporting Parties |  noting trends and patterns |  areas of convergence and divergence |  data gaps and other appropriate conclusions |  including the overall effects of policies and measures. It demonstrated that while Annex I Parties are fulfilling their commitments to the implementation of national policies and measures on the mitigation of climate change |  they need to make additional efforts to overcome difficulties that they face in achieving the aim of returning their emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000. 6. Another link to furthering the goals of sustainable development is the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) |  whose Second Assessment Report is considered to be the most comprehensive and authoritative assessment now available of the scientific and technical information regarding global climate change. The IPCC has now initiated steps towards preparation of its Third Assessment Report to develop a better objective scientific understanding of issues related to climate change |  its impacts and possible |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1997/6 English Page 23 |  |  |  | response options. This report is expected to enhance the formulation of climate change policies in the context of sustainable development. 7. New initiatives for cooperative implementation |  including technology transfer and diffusion |  between all Parties to the Convention and with the major groups in civil society are also being explored by the Parties to the Convention. Through these linkages the key themes of Agenda 21 pertaining to integrated policy development |  citizen participation in decisionmaking |  institutional and human capacity building and global partnerships involving many stakeholders |  are being addressed by the UNFCCC. 8. The UNFCCC has also taken first steps to deal with the continued rise of emissions and concentrations of greenhouse gases. The Berlin Mandate agreed by the first Conference of the Parties is the basis for considerable efforts under way in the Ad hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM). The COP |  at its second session |  called |  inter alia |  for acceleration of negotiations of the text of a protocol |  or another legal instrument which would fully encompass the remit of the Berlin Mandate. The General Assembly |  at its special session |  may wish to encourage member States to agree on a satisfactory result of these negotiations at the third session of the COP |  scheduled to be held in Kyoto in December 1997. 9. Steps are being taken by developing country Parties to prepare their initial communication of information related to implementation. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) |  as the interim operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention |  is supporting developing country Parties in implementing their commitments by funding enabling activities such as planning and endogenous capacity building. The Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) called on the GEF to provide expeditious and timely support to these Parties and initiate work towards a full replenishment in 1997. 10. Further international action in the implementation of Agenda 21 will help to involve the whole international community in promoting the effective implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 11. Noting the relevant provisions of Agenda 21 relating to the transfer of environmentally sound technology |  cooperation and capacity building |  the COP at its first and second sessions took decisions related to these issues. The General Assembly may also wish to pay special attention to the transfer of technology. |  |  |  | ----- |  |  |  |

At its 4th meeting |  the SBI considered and adopted conclusions2 proposed by the Chair. 2. Conclusions 10. The SBI welcomed the summary report on in-depth reviews of national communications from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) (FCCC/CP/2004/INF.2) and the executive summary of the information on national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory data from Annex I Parties for the period 1990–2002 (FCCC/CP/2004/5). The SBI noted with appreciation the high quality of these documents |  which help in the review of the implementation of the Convention by Annex I Parties and in sharing experiences among Parties. The SBI noted that such documents should also include additional information on ‘net’ GHG emissions. 11. The SBI took note of the status of the submission of national communications and their in-depth reviews (FCCC/SBI/2004/INF.9) and concluded that the third cycle of in-depth reviews contributed to the efficient and transparent assessment of the implementation of the Convention by Annex I Parties. 12. The SBI noted that total GHG emissions of Annex I Parties |  as summarized in documents FCCC/CP/2004/5 and FCCC/CP/2004/INF.2 |  decreased by 6.3 per cent from 1990 to 2002 |  although GHG emissions from some of these Parties have increased since 1990 and emissions have grown considerably in some sectors |  such as transport (an increase of about 20 per cent from 1990 to 2002) and international aviation (an increase of more than 40 per cent from 1990 to 2002). The SBI observed that total GHG emissions from Annex I Parties as a whole remained relatively stable between 2000 and 2002. 13. The SBI also noted that the most recent GHG emission projections |  summarized in document FCCC/CP/2004/INF.2 |  suggest that between 2000 and 2010 total GHG emissions of Annex I Parties could increase by about 13 per cent |  despite the mitigation measures currently in place. The SBI urged Annex I Parties to make additional efforts to reverse this trend. 14. The SBI took note of the report on the workshop on the preparation of fourth national communications from Annex I Parties |  held in Dublin |  Ireland |  on 30 September and 1 October 2004 (FCCC/SBI/2004/INF.14).

It recalled that Annex I Parties that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol shall also include in that national communication supplementary information under Article 7.2 of the Kyoto Protocol. The SBI also recalled decisions 22/CP.7 and 25/CP.8 urging Annex I Parties which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol to submit |  by 1 January 2006 |  a report demonstrating the progress they have made in achieving their commitments under the Protocol. 16. The SBI further recalled that draft decision -/CMP.1 (Modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts) attached to decision 19/CP.7 requires Annex I Parties with a commitment inscribed in Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol to submit |  before 1 January 2007 or one year after the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol for that Party (whichever is later) |  a report on the calculation of its assigned amount pursuant to Article 3 |  paragraphs 7 and 8 |  and on its capacity to account for its emissions and assigned amount. The SBI urged those Parties to inform the secretariat |  by 1 April 2005 |  when they intend to submit their reports. 17. The SBI noted that the national communications and the reports mentioned in paragraph 16 will be subject to review. The SBI requested the secretariat to prepare a note |  for consideration at its twenty-third session (November 2005) |  on options for streamlining these review processes |  in order to avoid possible duplication of effort and ensure efficient use of available resources. |  |  |  | IV.

The SBI expressed its appreciation to the secretariat for its efforts in organizing workshops |  noting that considerable time and effort are necessary to ensure that workshops are organized in an efficient manner and lead to productive recommendations. The SBI noted that the lack of sufficient and predictable funding makes organizing workshops difficult. 100. The SBI also noted that the lack of sufficient and predictable funding is the main reason for delays in the organization of workshops. The SBI urged Parties to ensure that timely and sufficient funding is provided for workshops |  and to make un-earmarked contributions to the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities for the funding of workshops |  to the extent possible. The SBI requested the secretariat |  in the absence of predictable funding |  to postpone a workshop rather than provide insufficient time for preparations and invitations. 101. The SBI noted the need to ensure balanced participation of Parties in workshops. In this context |  the SBI requested the secretariat to publish information about upcoming workshops on the UNFCCC web site. The SBI encouraged Parties to submit to the secretariat |  in a timely manner |  expressions of interest in participating in particular workshops.

The SBI requested the secretariat to ensure that |  for workshops which are confirmed |  invitations and documentation are made available to participants in a timely manner. 103. The SBI welcomed the secretariat’s policy of accepting |  in consultation with the chairs of the subsidiary bodies |  invitations from Parties to host workshops |  while acknowledging that this has sometimes led to increased costs |  and travel and visa complications. The SBI urged the secretariat to continue this approach in a prudent manner. 104. The SBI also took note of the information on the human resources and the staff selection policy and procedures of the secretariat. The SBI requested the Executive Secretary to strengthen her or his efforts to ensure a wider geographical balance in the appointment of staff at senior and managerial levels within the rubric of Article 101.3 of the Charter of the United Nations and the applicable rules |  guidelines and practices of the United Nations and the secretariat. 105. The SBI decided to continue its consideration of issues under this item annually. |  |  |  | 106. The SBI also requested the secretariat to take note of the concern expressed that officials of the secretariat should take care in their public statements to reflect the views of Parties held by consensus |  and not to appear to support only one side or another on contentious issues. |  |  |  | XI.

The SBI noted that Annex I Parties |  as reported in their fifth national communications |  are continuing to make progress in implementing their commitments under the Convention and calls on Annex I Parties to continue to intensify their efforts aimed at meeting their commitments under the Convention. The coverage of their respective domestic activities and the provision of the essential information on the implementation of the Convention at the international level have improved in the fifth national communications when compared with the preceding national communications. Despite these improvements |  some reporting issues and problems remain |  and the usefulness of the reported information could be enhanced by addressing these matters. Such issues include the need for reporting on the following: all elements (not only mandatory elements) of the “Guidelines for the preparation of national communications by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention |  Part II: UNFCCC reporting guidelines on national communications” (hereinafter referred to as the UNFCCC reporting guidelines |  Part II);9 emission scenarios and estimates of the impact of policies and measures; and financial assistance and technology transfer |  using approaches that are fully consistent with the UNFCCC reporting guidelines |  Part II. 18. The SBI called on Annex I Parties to enhance further |  where appropriate |  the completeness |  comparability and level of detail of the reported information in accordance with the UNFCCC reporting guidelines |  Part II. 19. The SBI noted that over the period 1990–2008 the total aggregate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions excluding emissions/removals from land use |  land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) for all Annex I Parties decreased by 6.0 per cent |  and the total GHG emissions/removals including LULUCF decreased by 10.7 per cent. For Annex I Parties with economies in transition |  GHG emissions excluding and including LULUCF decreased by 36.7 per cent and 49.7 per cent |  respectively. For Annex I Parties that do not have economies in transition |  GHG emissions excluding and including LULUCF increased by 8.0 per cent and 8.4 per cent |  respectively. 20. The SBI decided to recommend a draft decision on the status of submission and review of fifth national communications from Annex I Parties and the compilation and synthesis of fifth national communications from Annex I Parties for adoption by the Conference of the Parties (COP) at its eighteenth session (for the final text of the draft decision |  see document FCCC/SBI/2012/15/Add.1). |  | 8 9 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/INF.1 and Add.1 and 2.

The SBI emphasized that the national communications and annual GHG inventories submitted by Annex I Parties that are also Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are the main source of information for reviewing the implementation of the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol by these Parties |  and that the reports on the in-depth reviews of these national communications provide important additional information for this purpose. 26. The SBI noted that the information reported in the fifth national communications shows that Annex I Parties that are also Parties to the Kyoto Protocol are improving the quality of their reporting under the Kyoto Protocol. 27. The SBI urged Annex I Parties that are also Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to enhance further the completeness |  comparability and level of detail of the reported information in accordance with the “Guidelines for the preparation of the information required under Article 7 of the Kyoto Protocol”.13 28. The SBI noted that the total aggregate GHG emissions of Annex I Parties that are also Parties to the Kyoto Protocol |  excluding emissions and removals from LULUCF |  decreased by 16.2 per cent; GHG emissions |  excluding emissions and removals from LULUCF |  from Annex I Parties that are also Parties to the Kyoto Protocol with economies in transition decreased by 36.4 per cent; and GHG emissions |  excluding emissions and removals from LULUCF |  from Annex I Parties that are also Parties to the Kyoto Protocol that do not have economies in transition increased by 0.1 per cent from the base year14 to 2008 |  and for several of these Parties the increase was higher than that level. |  | 10 11 |  |  |  | 12 13 14 |  |  |  | Adopted as document FCCC/SBI/2012/L.15.

Decision 1/CP.16 |  paragraphs 26–29 |  and decision 7/CP.17. 23 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/15 |  |  |  | appropriate approaches |  methods and tools depends upon regional |  national and local capacity |  contexts and circumstances and involves the engagement of all relevant stakeholders; (c) Gaps in the assessment of the risk of loss and damage for vulnerable communities and populations |  including women and children |  can be addressed by involving these communities and populations in risk assessment processes; (d) The use of local and indigenous knowledge and observations helps to fill gaps in information about historical exposure and vulnerability; (e) Assessment of the risk of loss and damage is often constrained by the limited availability of data and knowledge |  including |  but not limited to |  that on weather |  climate |  socioeconomic conditions and ecosystems. Risk management actions can still be taken in the absence of complete sets of data and knowledge |  taking into account the national circumstances; (f) Access to |  sharing and the use of information and data |  such as hydrometeorological data and metadata |  on a voluntary basis is important to facilitate the assessment and management of climate-related risk; (g) Enhanced technical and institutional capacities supported by technical and financial assistance and other resources will help developing countries to continue to determine |  prioritize and address their needs in assessing the risk of loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change; (h) Involvement of |  and dialogue with |  decision makers at all levels can strengthen the design |  dissemination and delivery of information on climate risk; (i) Numerical data are sometimes not sufficient in conveying a comprehensive range of the risks of loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change since available estimates on losses typically lack numbers on non-economic losses. 151. The SBI noted the importance of adopting a holistic approach in considering the three thematic areas of the work programme on loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change | 59 and of drawing upon relevant work under and outside the Convention. 152. The SBI recalled that the COP |  at its seventeenth session |  requested the secretariat to organize four expert meetings |  three at the regional level and one for small island developing States |  to be held before the thirty-seventh session of the SBI |  to address issues related to a range of approaches to address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change |  including impacts related to extreme weather events and slow onset events |  taking into consideration experience at all levels of the work programme.60 153. The SBI recalled the objective of the work programme to consider approaches to address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change |  and appreciated the need to explore a range of approaches and potential mechanisms |  including an international mechanism |  to address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change |  with a view to making recommendations on loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change to the COP for its consideration at its eighteenth session. 154. The SBI requested the secretariat |  in consultation with Parties and relevant stakeholders |  in organizing the four expert meetings mentioned in paragraph 152 above to take into account |  to the extent possible |  the following: |  | 59 60 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/7 |  paragraph 109(a–c). Decision 7/CP.17 |  paragraph 8(a). |  |  |  | 24 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/15 |  |  |  | (a) Inviting representatives from regional centres and networks |  as well as experts from a wide range of relevant domains |  disciplines and communities |  including those involved in the development of the IPCC assessments and special reports |  and experts in disaster risk reduction and in financial approaches to risk management |  subject to the availability of financial resources |  to attend the expert meetings; (b) Requesting presenters to make available the abstracts of the materials to be presented at the expert meetings in advance |  in order to assist participants to better prepare for the discussions. 155. To facilitate the completion of its work |  the SBI requested its Chair to convene an informal pre-sessional meeting of Parties |  in conjunction with its thirty-seventh session |  subject to the availability of resources and conflicts of timing |  to exchange further views on the possible recommendations on loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change. 156.

See paragraphs 43–44 and 140 of the technical paper FCCC/TP/2011/3 (hereinafter referred to as TP). Some of the considerations related to possible delegation of the appeals mandate to the Compliance Committee are outlined in paragraphs 100–103 of the TP.

In the latter case |  some of the provisions in the Executive Board recommendations (i.e. chapters V |  VII |  VIII |  IX and XII of annex II to document FCCC/CMP/2010/10) could be used to further develop the detailed rules. This chapter would only be relevant for a newly created body |  such as a standing body or a roster. Unless Parties decide otherwise |  the relevant provisions of decision 27/CMP.1 would apply to the composition and membership of the enforcement branch of the Compliance Committee |  should it be designated to hear appeals. Parties are also invited to examine considerations set out in paragraphs 76–78 of the TP and consider whether a longer term of office (e.g. 5 or 7 years) might be desirable. 43 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/7 |  |  |  | 10.

If all efforts at reaching consensus have been exhausted and no agreement has been reached |  decisions |  |  |  | 7 |  |  |  | 8 |  |  |  | 9 |  |  |  | Parties may wish to consider the appropriate amount and how the time should be calculated (e.g. only for the days spent in the panel meeting or an average time per appeal). Parties may also wish to consider whether a retainer fee should be paid to members to facilitate their availability to hear appeals on short notice. Considerations in this regard are set out in paragraphs 85–89 of the TP. The remuneration option is proposed for options 1 and 3.

Three Parties informed the SBI that their latest contributions had not been reflected in document FCCC/SBI/2001/INF.3/Rev.1. The delegations concerned were encouraged to approach the secretariat with written evidence of transfer of funds in order to enable further investigations to be made with the United Nations Treasury. 34. A few Parties sought clarification regarding the impact the revised United Nations scale of assessments would have on the indicative contributions to the Convention |  particularly with respect to determining ceilings. In its reply |  the secretariat drew the attention of the SBI to the financial procedures of the Convention |  which stipulate that contributions should be “based on such a scale of assessments of the United Nations as may be adopted from time to time by the General Assembly” (FCCC/CP/1995/7/Add.1 |  decision 15/CP.1 |  annex I |  para. 7 (a)). 2. Conclusions 35. At its 2nd meeting |  on 27 July |  after considering the documents prepared by the secretariat on the revised indicative contributions and the latest status of contributions |  the SBI took note of the information contained therein and expressed its appreciation to the Parties which had paid their contributions to the core budget in time |  and particularly to those Parties that had made voluntary contributions to the Trust Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC Process and the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities. It urged Parties that had not yet made their contributions to do so as soon as possible. B. Programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003 (Agenda item 4 (b)) 1. Proceedings 36.

In addition |  it agreed to propose a contingency budget for conference servicing amounting to US$ 5 | 661 | 900 |  to be added to the programme budget for 2002-2003 in the event that the General Assembly of the United Nations decides not to provide resources for these activities in the United Nations regular budget for the same biennium. 41. It also authorized the Executive Secretary to notify Parties of their indicative 2002 contributions based on the recommended budget |  after drawing up to US$ 5 million from the available resources carried over from the current and previous financial periods |  and taking into account the special annual contribution from the host Government of the equivalent of DM 1.5 million. 42. The SBI requested the Executive Secretary to propose a revised programme budget including a revised staffing table |  on this basis |  taking into account |  inter alia |  the budgetary implications of the decisions adopted by the COP at its sixth session |  for consideration by the SBI at its fifteenth session. 43. The SBI commended the efforts of the Executive Secretary and his senior managers to ensure the highest standards of efficiency |  competence and integrity in the staffing of the UNFCCC secretariat |  while paying due regard to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible |  in accordance with Article 101.3 of the United Nations Charter |  as well as of promoting gender balance. 44. The SBI noted that |  as indicated in the proposal by the Executive Secretary contained in document FCCC/SBI/2001/4 |  the incoming Executive Secretary would enjoy managerial flexibility in implementing the programme budget. C. Implementation of the Headquarters Agreement (Agenda item 4 (c)) 1. Proceedings 45. The SBI considered this sub-item at its 1st and 2nd meetings |  on 24 and 27 July respectively. The Executive Secretary explained that a solution to the need for adequate office space for the Convention secretariat in the medium term was still under discussion with the host Government. The current interim solution involving the provision of overflow premises had proved workable. However |  the secretariat looked forward to being reunited in premises that |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2001/9 English Page 10 would meet its needs. He stated that the offer of space by the host Government to the secretariats of the UNFCCC and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification had been judged inadequate. 46. Adding to the statement of the Executive Secretary |  the Coordinator |  Information |  Outreach and Administrative Services (IOAS) |  reported that the secretariat had noticed a marked improvement since the last report was made to the SBI |  in the issuance of visas for dependent children studying abroad |  work permits for spouses and dependent children |  travel in and out of Germany |  and visas for visiting family members. In addition |  improvements had also been noted in respect of the issuance of visas for new staff members |  consultants and experts working with the secretariat and participants in workshops |  meetings and conferences. He explained that negotiations would continue on a number of related issues which were part of the continuing process of implementing the Headquarters Agreement. 47. The representative of Germany informed the SBI that his Government was holding continuous consultations with the various United Nations organizations in Bonn and was working hard with counterpart ministries to finalize the plan for a United Nations Campus. He welcomed the remarks by the secretariat on the interim office space provided and the improvements noted on other issues. Referring to the issuance of visas |  the representative of Germany stated that no delegate had reported problems in obtaining a visa to attend the current Conference of the Parties; if there were any problems |  his delegation should be contacted. 48. The representative of one Party proposed the creation of a representative group of Parties to monitor the fulfilment of the Headquarters Agreement and to consider with the host Government matters relating to it |  in order to support the negotiations of the secretariat. 49. The representative of another Party opposed the creation of such a group. 2. Conclusions 50. At its 1st and 2nd meetings |  on 24 and 27 July respectively |  the SBI took note of the statements made by the Executive Secretary |  the Coordinator |  IOAS |  and the host Government. The SBI thanked the host Government for its efforts to provide acceptable office accommodation for the Convention secretariat and invited the host Government and the secretariat to continue their negotiations to resolve this important issue by the earliest possible date. The SBI asked the host Government and the secretariat to provide a progress report on this and matters relating to the Headquarters Agreement at its next session. D.

The SBI considered this sub-item at its 1st and 2nd meetings |  on 24 and 27 July respectively. It had before it document FCCC/SBI/2001/5.

The Executive Secretary introduced document FCCC/SBI/2001/5 |  which described the state of this linkage as being satisfactory. He drew attention to the consultations which had taken place with relevant officials of the United Nations and to the recommendation of the Secretary-General of the United Nations that the institutional linkage be extended for a further five years. 53. A statement was made by the representative of one Party. 2. Conclusions 54. At its 1st meeting |  on 24 July |  the SBI took note of the oral statement made by the Executive Secretary and the related document FCCC/SBI/2001/5. 55. At its 2nd meeting |  on 27 July |  having considered a proposal by the Chairman |  the SBI decided to recommend a draft decision (FCCC/CP/2001/L.8) on the institutional linkage of the UNFCCC secretariat to the United Nations for consideration by the COP at its resumed sixth session. E. Juridical personality of the Convention secretariat on the international plane (Agenda item 4 (e)) 1. Proceedings 56. The SBI considered this sub-item at its 1st and 2nd meetings |  on 24 and 27 July respectively. 57. A statement was made by the representative of one Party. 2. Conclusions 58. At its 2nd meeting |  on 27 July |  the SBI took note of the fact that the Convention secretariat was vested with juridical personality in Germany where the headquarters of the secretariat is located and further noted that the absence of juridical personality on the international plane had not inhibited the secretariat in the effective performance of its functions. The SBI decided to hold the issue in abeyance and revisit the matter at a future date if the status of the secretariat should necessitate that it be vested with juridical personality on the international plane.

On progress made and positive experiences: • • A lot of information has been generated in response to the provisions of Article 4 |  paragraph 8 |  of the Convention and its subsequent process (including through the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change). Developing countries have made progress in the conceptual understanding of adaptation and in conducting assessments at the national level (national adaptation programmes of action and national communications were highlighted as very positive experiences). Good practices have been identified |  which can be replicated and/or scaled up. Developed countries are providing some support for adaptation |  both through multilateral funding channels and bilaterally. International organizations have also been increasing their engagement in the adaptation process and identifying good practices that can be replicated on a larger scale. Work has been carried out on integrating adaptation with other national priorities |  including through development initiatives such as poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs). |  |  |  | • • • |  |  |  | 2. On the possible enabling role of the UNFCCC process: • The UNFCCC process could enable further action through: o Promoting the sharing of experiences. o Promoting implementation of the elements of the least developed countries programme of work that have not yet been addressed. o Highlighting socio-economic information related to climate change and links with relevant sectors. o Providing more information on access to funding. o Enhancing institutional arrangements that support education |  training and public awareness. o Promoting outreach and networking with other sectors. |  |  |  | 3. On the gaps and barriers that need more work: • • Implementation lags behind assessment. More work is needed on the practical aspects of adaptation. Funding is insufficient |  and there are difficulties in accessing the existing funding and support under the UNFCCC process (problems with co-financing |  delays in obtaining Global Environment Facility funding |  etc.). Adequate funding provided through simplified |  expedited procedures is needed for the period up to 2012 and beyond. Significant gaps in capacity exist in planning |  programming and implementing at all levels. There are also gaps in information and data sets |  particularly information and data that are sectorspecific (including non-traditional sectors) and historical. Decision-support tools |  especially tools for costbenefit analysis of the socio-economic implications of climate change |  are needed. |  |  |  | • • |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2009/8 Page 34 • • • There is a need for regional centres and/or other institutional arrangements to respond to technical requirements. More has to be done to promote integration of adaptation with other development priorities |  identify synergy between them and engage a wider range of stakeholders in the adaptation process. There is a need for specific support to particularly vulnerable regions |  such as Africa. Impact of the implementation of response measures 1. On progress made and positive experiences: • • • The level of understanding of the issue has improved. Examples of efforts to minimize the impact of the implementation of response measures include economic diversification through development of tourism. In some sectors |  this issue is being addressed in collaboration with the industry concerned as well as other stakeholders. Capacity-building is taking place for assessing the impact of the implementation of response measures |  although not significantly. |  |  |  | 2. On the possible enabling role of the UNFCCC process: • The UNFCCC process could enable further work through: o Facilitating the development of methodologies. o Assessing the impact of implementation of response measures |  especially through enhancing modelling and economic diversification. o Addressing the impact of the implementation of response measures and recommending decisions through an entity set up under Subsidiary Body for Implementation (e.g. a forum |  mechanism or body). |  |  |  | 3. On the gaps and barriers that need more work: • • • • There is a need for better assessment of the impact of implementation of response measures (given the difficulties in measuring them in isolation from other economic and political factors) and assistance in measuring these impacts. Better modelling and supportive assessments are required. There is a need for capacity-building |  sharing of experiences and greater understanding of risk. Economic diversification is key. Transitions within sectors need to be just (some lose jobs while others gain). To ensure political sustainability |  the climate change regime should anticipate the costs and strive to minimize the negative impacts due to this transformation. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2009/8 Page 35 Annex IV [ENGLISH ONLY] |  |  |  | Text for further consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Implementation and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice Matters relating to Article 3 |  paragraph 14 |  of the Kyoto Protocol |  | 1. [The Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) [and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA)] welcomed the constructive exchange of views on addressing issues relevant to Article 3 |  paragraph 14 |  [and Article 2 |  paragraph 3 | ] of the Kyoto Protocol and on the efforts being made under the SBI with regard to [this issue] [opportunities for further action] [in order to implement decision 31/CMP.1]. 2. The SBI [and the SBSTA] emphasized that better understanding of these issues is essential in [order to strive to minimize the adverse impacts of the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol] [minimizing the adverse impacts of the implementation of the commitments mentioned in Article 3 |  paragraph 1 |  of the Kyoto Protocol] |  in particular for [the poorest and most vulnerable developing country Parties that are the least capable of addressing them] [those countries referred to in Article 4 |  paragraphs 8 |  9 [and 10] |  of the Convention]. 2 bis. The SBI [and the SBSTA] emphasized the value of taking a phased approach to establish[ing] a process for the implementation of [decision 31/CMP.1 | ] [relating to] [Article 2 |  paragraph 3 |  and] [Article 3 |  paragraph 14 |  of the Kyoto Protocol]. 3. The SBI [and the SBSTA] acknowledged related discussions under other UNFCCC bodies such as the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention and the Ad Hoc Working Group on Further Commitments for Annex I Parties under the Kyoto Protocol |  and encouraged Parties to ensure coordination of activities and information across the bodies in order [to ensure a coherent and consistent approach] to better address the issues mentioned in paragraph 2 above. 3 bis. The SBI and the SBSTA noted the complexities of assessing the attribution and causation of the [adverse] impacts of policies and measures. 4. Option 1: The SBI [and the SBSTA] noted the need to share information on reporting methodologies on ways to minimize adverse social |  environmental and economic impacts on developing country Parties of the implementation of policies and measures by Parties included in Annex I to the Convention in achieving their quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments under Article 3 |  paragraph 1 |  of the Kyoto Protocol. Option 2: The SBI and the SBSTA noted the need to continue to share information on the nature of impacts of response measures experienced by Parties and the steps Parties are taking to minimize any negative impacts. 4 bis. The SBI [and the SBSTA] noted that national communications under Article 12 |  paragraph 1 |  of the Convention would be an appropriate means for sharing the information referred to in paragraph 4 above. 5. The SBI [and the SBSTA] also noted the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on international spillover effects as described in its Fourth Assessment Report. [It invited the IPCC to [assess this issue further in its Fifth Assessment Report.] [provide |  in its Fifth Assessment Report |  further information on these effects[ |  including on actual adverse impacts of the commitments |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2009/8 Page 36 mentioned in Article 3 |  paragraph 1 |  of the Kyoto Protocol on other Parties and possible measures to minimize them.] 5 bis. The SBI further invited the IPCC to develop guidelines to help determine if Parties included in Annex I to the Convention are striving to minimize adverse effects including the adverse effects of climate change |  effects on international trade |  and social |  environmental and economic impacts on other Parties |  especially developing country Parties |  and in particular those identified in Article 4 |  paragraphs 8 and 9 |  of the Convention. 6. The SBI [and the SBSTA] noted that further discussion is needed on this matter |  and invited Parties and relevant organizations to submit to the secretariat |  by XXX |  further information and views on [issues relevant to Article 2 |  paragraph 3 |  and Article 3 |  paragraph 14 |  of the Kyoto Protocol.] [the reporting methodologies referred to in decision 31/CMP.1 |  paragraph 3.] 7. The SBI [and the SBSTA] requested the secretariat to compile the submissions referred to in paragraph 6 above into a miscellaneous document [and prepare a synthesis report] for its consideration. 8. The SBI [and the SBSTA] agreed to continue its consideration of these issues at its XX session [[in a joint contact group] |  [including consideration of the need for a workshop] to share further information among Parties and the information contained in the submissions referred to in paragraph 6 above] [and the synthesis report referred to in paragraph 7 above].] |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2009/8 Page 37 Annex V [ENGLISH ONLY] |  |  |  | Privileges and immunities for individuals serving on constituted bodies established under the Kyoto Protocol Draft treaty arrangements developed by the Contact Group |  | 1.

Proceedings |  |  |  | 11. At its 1st and 4th meetings |  on 27 February and 1 March 1966 |  respectively |  the SBI addressed the item on national communications from Parties included in Annex I to the Convention. It had before it two documents prepared by the secretariat |  FCCC/SB/1996/1 and FCCC/SB/1996/2. 12. Statements were made by the representatives of 13 Parties including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. 2. Conclusions |  |  |  | 13. On the basis of proposals by the Chairman |  the SBI |  at its 5th meeting on 4 March 1996 adopted the following conclusions. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1996/9 English Page 7 |  |  |  | 14. The SBI took note of the progress report on in-depth reviews (FCCC/SB/1996/2) and of the in-depth review reports issued so far (FCCC/IDR.1/CZE |  FCCC/IDR.1/SWE |  FCCC/IDR.1/AUS |  FCCC/IDR.1/USA |  FCCC/IDR.1/CAN |  FCCC/IDR.1/CHE). It expressed its appreciation to the Parties which have hosted in-depth review visits |  to the Parties and intergovernmental organizations which have nominated experts and to the secretariat for the coordination of these reviews. 15. The SBI concluded that the progress report on in-depth reviews provided useful information on the implementation of the Convention. It also urged the Parties included in Annex I to the Convention that have not yet submitted national communications to do so in time for the second session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 2). 16. The SBI envisaged that policy aspects of the available in-depth review reports were to be fully considered as a separate agenda item at its third session in order to draw relevant conclusions to the attention of the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate at its fourth session and to the COP at its second session. 17. The SBI invited the SBSTA to consider ways of enhancing transparency |  comparability and consistency through more specific reporting guidelines |  including standard formats and tables |  inter alia |  for the description of policies and measures. In doing so |  these Parties are invited to describe |  to the extent possible |  the specific effects expected from individual mitigation measures. 18. The SBI invited the SBSTA to analyse from a technical point of view reporting options on such issues as temperature adjustments |  electricity trade |  bunker fuels |  use of global warming potentials and land use change and forestry to resolve inconsistencies in the reporting of inventories with the aim of enhancing comparability. It also invited the SBSTA to make relevant recommendations to the SBI. 19. The SBI endorsed the outline and approaches proposed for the second compilation and synthesis of first national communications |  as described in document FCCC/SB/1996/1 |  and suggested that the presentation of policies and measures should highlight those that are innovative |  successful and/or potentially replicable. 20. The SBI took note of preliminary data presented in document FCCC/SB/1996/1/Add.1 on projections of emissions of greenhouse gases for the year 2000 which indicate that many Annex I Parties will have to make additional efforts beyond those included in projections in order to return their greenhouse gas emissions not controlled by the Montreal Protocol to base year levels by 2000. 21. The SBI concluded that mechanisms should be explored to facilitate the exchange of experiences in carrying out national programmes to implement the Convention. In that context |  the SBI requested the secretariat to convene an informal workshop |  preferably in conjunction with the fourth session of the SBI |  focusing the discussion on the implementation |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1996/9 English Page 8 |  |  |  | aspects of specific policies and measures taken by these Parties. This workshop could also present an opportunity to assess the results of the first cycle of in-depth reviews. |  |  |  | B. |  |  |  | Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention: issues related to the compilation and consideration of information 1. Proceedings |  |  |  | 22. At its 5th meeting |  on 4 March 1996 |  the SBI addressed the item on communications from non-Annex I Parties.

The SBI recalled decision 8/CP.1. Conclusions |  |  |  | 25. The SBI took note of document FCCC/SB/1996/3. It also noted with appreciation document FCCC/SB/1996/MISC.1/Add.1 containing the position paper of the Group of 77 and China on recommendations on guidelines and format for the preparation of initial communications from non-Annex I Parties |  which was developed on the basis of the workshop held on 26 February 1996. 26. The SBI considered document FCCC/SB/1996/MISC.1/Add.1 as the principal basis for the decision to adopt and implement guidelines and format for the preparation of initial communications from non-Annex I Parties. It also noted that the SBSTA would continue consideration of the item at its subsequent session. 27. The SBI noted the intention of non-Annex I Parties to conduct a workshop |  as a follow-up to the earlier one |  to address issues relating to implementation |  and requested the secretariat to facilitate assistance in this regard |  in accordance with Article 8.2. 28. The SBI recalled its conclusions on agenda item 4 (a). |  |  |  | 29. The SBI invited non-Annex I Parties to nominate national focal points for facilitating assistance for the preparation of the initial communications. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1996/9 English Page 9 |  |  |  | 30. The SBI requested the secretariat to continue to facilitate assistance to non-Annex I Parties |  in accordance with Article 8.2 |  by organizing forums for the exchange of experiences |  and by providing relevant information |  including exchanges between Parties |  on the preparation of initial communications |  using the resources of the supplementary fund. |  |  |  | IV. |  |  |  | FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION (Agenda item 4) A.

On the basis of proposals by the Chairman |  the SBI |  at its 5th meeting |  on 4 March |  adopted the following conclusions. 35. The SBI considered document FCCC/SBI/1996/3 and took note of the information contained therein on relevant action taken by the Council of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) |  including the adoption by the Council of the GEF of its operational strategy. 36. In this regard |  the SBI concluded that: |  |  |  | (a) The GEF |  as the interim operating entity of the financial mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) |  and its implementing agencies should provide expeditious and timely support under Articles 4.3 and 12.5 for the preparation of national communications by developing country Parties in accordance with Article 12.1; (b) The GEF |  as the interim operating entity of the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC |  should |  in that connection |  consider country-specific needs but could also consider approaches which may be used for several countries with similar needs |  upon request |  and take into account that the preparation of national communications is a continuing process. In |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1996/9 English Page 10 |  |  |  | this regard |  the guidelines to be adopted by the COP on the preparation of national communications by non-Annex I Parties should be taken fully into account; (c) The GEF |  as the interim operating entity of the financial mechanism of the UNFCCC |  in this initial period |  should implement enabling activities consistent with the guidance provided to it by the COP and expedite the disbursement of resources to meet the agreed full costs of such activities in accordance with Article 4.3 |  in particular the initial and subsequent preparation of national communications of non-Annex I Parties. |  |  |  | B. |  |  |  | Technical and financial cooperation: progress report 1.

The SBI considered document FCCC/SBI/1996/4 and took note of the information contained therein on secretariat activities in the area of technical and financial cooperation |  in particular on its efforts to advance the activities known as CC:INFO |  CC:FORUM and CC:TRAIN. 41. In this regard |  the SBI concluded that: |  |  |  | (a) Services provided by the secretariat in this area should be recognized |  in particular those promoting the exchange of information through CC:INFO and those aiming at the coordination of activities and the effective utilization of resources for support to the preparation of national communications through CC:FORUM; (b) The secretariat should prepare a report for the next session of the SBI on possibilities for strengthening and expanding these activities in support of the preparation of the national communications by Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1996/9 English Page 11 |  |  |  | V. |  |  |  | TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY (Agenda item 5) 1.

The SBI requested the SBSTA to prepare recommendations on the guidelines for national communications by Annex I Parties for consideration at the third session of the SBI. The SBI recommended that the modifications should aim to improve the comprehensiveness |  comparability and detail of information provided in national communications and should reflect option 3 given in document FCCC/SBI/1996/5 while noting the need for flexibility in reporting private sector activities. 52. The SBI further requested the secretariat to prepare a report |  after consultations with relevant United Nations agencies and other organizations and institutions |  on technology transfer cooperation by the private sector |  for consideration by the SBI |  preferably in time for COP 3 |  but no later than COP 4. 53.

With a view to enabling the secretariat to effectively discharge its functions under the Convention |  such an agreement should |  in particular |  reflect the following: (i) The Convention secretariat should possess in the host country such legal capacity as is necessary for the effective discharge of its functions under |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1996/9 English Page 15 |  |  |  | the Convention |  in particular to contract |  to acquire and dispose of movable and immovable property and to institute legal proceedings; (ii) The Convention secretariat should enjoy in the territory of the host country such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the effective discharge of its functions under the Convention; The representatives of the Parties and Observer States to the Convention as well as the officials of the Convention secretariat should similarly enjoy such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the independent exercise of their functions under the Convention. |  |  |  | (iii) |  |  |  | (d) Noted that the agreement should be subject to approval by the COP at its second session; (e) Noted also that the Executive Secretary intends to conclude arrangements with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for the management |  use and servicing of the common United Nations premises in Bonn; (f) Noted further that the relocation of the offices and the staff of the Convention secretariat will start in August 1996 and end later in the year; invited the Executive Secretary to promote conditions of service in Bonn consistent with the United Nations Staff Regulations and Rules and that will help to maintain a critical mass of the existing secretariat team by encouraging experienced staff members of all categories and linguistic backgrounds to relocate; and expresses the hope that the loss of staff and of productivity on account of relocation will be as short-lived as possible; (g) Expressed its appreciation to the Government of Germany for its continuing commitment to fulfil the terms of its offer to host the Convention secretariat and to facilitate the resettlement of its staff in attractive conditions; (h) Requested the Executive Secretary to report to it at its third session on progress achieved on the above matters |  so that it may make recommendations for appropriate action by the COP at its second session; (i) Further requested the Executive Secretary to report to it at its third session on practical arrangements for liaison with Parties during and after the relocation of the secretariat |  including possible joint liaison arrangements with other secretariats in Geneva. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1996/9 English Page 16 |  |  |  | VIII. |  |  |  | ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE SECOND SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES (Agenda item 8) 1.

The SBI took note of the conclusions of the AWG-LCA |  at its second session |  on the work programme of the AWG-LCA for 2009.55 134. The SBI recommended that when scheduling meetings |  including workshops and pre-sessional meetings |  every effort should be made to avoid three-week blocks. 135. The SBI agreed that meetings in 2009 for which venues have not yet been fixed should |  to the extent possible |  be held in Bonn |  Germany |  or cities with major United Nations or international organizations facilities |  preferably those which have Permanent Missions |  in order to minimize the cost and logistical burden of organizing these meetings and to facilitate participation and coordination by developing country Parties. The SBI also requested the secretariat to seek guidance from the Bureau on venues for its meetings in 2009 |  in the event that the venues referred to above are not available. 136. The SBI recommended that additional sessional periods in 2009 for which dates have not yet been fixed be scheduled in March/April and August/September |  from mid-week to mid-week where possible in order to reduce the amount of weekend travel time required. The AWG-LCA and the AWG-KP would meet during these sessional periods. 137. The SBI invited Parties to make contributions to the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities to assist with the costs arising from the additional sessions in 2009 |  including those to be held in Bonn. The SBI also encouraged Parties to make contributions to the Trust Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC Process as soon as possible |  in order to ensure the effective participation of delegations from developing country Parties. 138.

The SBI invited Parties to come forward with offers to host COP 16 and CMP 6 (2010) |  as well as COP 17 and CMP 7 (2011). The SBI noted that |  in keeping with the principle of rotation among regional groups |  and in the light of recent consultations among the groups |  the President of COP 16 would come from the Group of Latin America and the Caribbean and the President of COP 17 would come from the African Group. 142. The SBI encouraged countries hosting future sessions of the COP and CMP |  if they are planning informal ministerial meetings bearing on climate change |  to consider holding such meetings well before the COP and CMP sessions to allow Parties time to reflect on the results of these meetings |  and to reduce scheduling conflicts during the sessions. 143. The SBI expressed its gratitude to the Government of Thailand for hosting the first session of the AWG-LCA and the first part of the fifth session of the AWG-KP |  and to the Government of Denmark for its generous financial support of these sessions. |  |  |  | XIV. Administrative |  financial and institutional matters |  | (Agenda item 14) A. Budget performance for the biennium 2008–2009 (Agenda item 14 (a)) 1. Proceedings 144. The SBI considered this sub-item at its 3rd and 4th meetings |  on 5 and 13 June |  respectively. It had before it documents FCCC/SBI/2008/3 and FCCC/SBI/2008/INF.6. Statements were made by representatives of three Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. 145. At its 3rd meeting |  the SBI agreed to consider this sub-item in informal consultations convened by Ms. Wenhang Huang (China). At the 4th meeting |  Ms. Huang reported on these consultations. 146. At its 4th meeting |  the SBI considered and adopted conclusions56 proposed by the Chair. 2. Conclusions 147. The SBI took note of the information on the budget performance for the biennium 2008–2009 |  including information on measures to address the adverse effects of the exchange rate fluctuations on the core budget of the secretariat | 57 and the status of contributions as at 15 May 2008.58 148. The SBI prepared texts for two draft decisions for the COP at its fourteenth session and the CMP at its fourth session |  and agreed to continue deliberating on this matter at its twenty-ninth session on the basis of these draft texts contained in annex V. 149. The SBI recommended that the COP and the CMP authorize the Executive Secretary to incur expenditure for the biennium in United States dollars up to the equivalent of EUR 41 | 172 | 06859 at the |  | 56 57 |  |  |  | Adopted as document FCCC/SBI/2008/L.6. FCCC/SBI/2008/3. 58 FCCC/SBI/2008/INF.6. 59 This amount was approved by the COP at its thirteenth session by its decision 13/CP.13. The authorization to spend up to this amount will not affect indicative contributions in the biennium 2008–2009. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/8 Page 24 average exchange rate between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009 |  provided that expenditure is covered by related income. 150. The SBI recommended that the COP and the CMP authorize the Executive Secretary to draw up to an additional USD 2.0 million from unspent balances (carry-over) from previous financial periods to offset part of the shortfall due to exchange rate fluctuations. 151. The SBI urged Parties to make voluntary contributions to the core budget to help cover the shortfall referred to in paragraph 150 above. 152. The SBI took note that the Executive Secretary may have to delay certain activities until such voluntary contributions are received. 153. The SBI recommended that the COP and the CMP request the Executive Secretary |  when preparing the programme budget for the biennium 2010–2011 for consideration by the SBI at its thirtieth session |  to take into consideration ways to minimize the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on the core budget |  including the measures suggested in document FCCC/SBI/2005/8. 154. The SBI expressed its appreciation to Parties that paid their contributions to the core budget in a timely manner |  and expressed concern over the outstanding contributions and urged those Parties that have not yet paid their contributions to do so as soon as possible. 155. The SBI acknowledged with appreciation the voluntary contributions made by Parties to the Trust Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC Process and to the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities |  and urged Parties to further contribute to these trust funds |  particularly in view of the decision60 to increase the number of sessions in 2008–2009. B. Implementation of the Headquarters Agreement (Agenda item 14 (b)) 1. Proceedings 156. The SBI considered this sub-item at its 3rd and 4th meetings |  on 5 and 13 June |  respectively.

The SBI took note of the statement by the Executive Secretary |  in which he expressed his general satisfaction with the implementation of the Headquarters Agreement and his desire that UNFCCC staff will remain under one roof at the current premises until the new offices are completed. 160. The SBI expressed its appreciation for the efforts made so far and encouraged the Host Government to further advance the implementation of the planned construction. It invited the Host |  | 60 61 |  |  |  | Decision 1/CP.13 (the Bali Action Plan). Adopted as document FCCC/SBI/2008/L.3. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/8 Page 25 Government and the Executive Secretary to report to it at its thirtieth session on further progress made on the implementation of the Headquarters Agreement. |  |  |  | XV. Other matters |  | (Agenda item 15) 161. The SBI considered this item at its 3rd and 4th meetings |  on 5 and 13 June |  respectively. Statements were made by representatives of four Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China |  one on behalf of AOSIS and one on behalf of the European Community and its member States. 162. At the 3rd meeting |  the Group of 77 and China requested information on the status of the operationalization of the Adaptation Fund. At the same meeting |  the Chair invited Mr. Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) |  Chair of the Adaptation Fund Board |  to report on the work of the board to implement decision 1/CMP.3. 163.

At its 4th meeting |  on 13 June |  the SBI considered and adopted the draft report on its twenty-eighth session (FCCC/SBI/2008/L.1). At the same meeting |  on a proposal by the Chair |  the SBI authorized the Chair to complete the report on the session |  with the assistance of the secretariat. |  |  |  | XVII. Closure of the session |  | 166. At the 4th meeting |  on 13 June |  the Executive Secretary shared with the SBI a preliminary evaluation of the financial impact of conclusions adopted by all bodies that had just met in Bonn. This follows decision 16/CP.9 |  paragraph 20 |  which requests the Executive Secretary to provide an indication of the administrative and budgetary implications of decisions62 that cannot be met from existing resources within the core budget. 167. The Executive Secretary indicated that most of the additional activities that the secretariat had been asked to undertake could be undertaken within resources foreseen in the core budget or that had already been envisaged in the initial budget estimates under the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities. However |  financial resources for at least two additional sessions of the ad hoc working groups in 2009 will need to be raised |  amounting to between USD 4.5 million and USD 5.8 million per session |  depending on the location. If another additional meeting is deemed to be necessary |  this will increase the requirements further. This will also have an impact on the Trust Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC Process |  which will need at least USD 1.4 million for each additional session to provide adequate financial support to developing countries |  including support for a second delegate from LDCs and small island developing States. |  |  |  | 62 |  |  |  | While decision 16/CP.9 refers to “decisions” |  it does have implications for conclusions of the subsidiary bodies as well. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/8 Page 26 168. The secretariat has been requested to prepare a number of technical papers and an information note to support work under the AWG-LCA |  which will cost in the region of USD 1.36 million. Under the SBSTA |  approximately USD 2 million is needed to cover a wide range of activities that the secretariat has been asked to undertake to support the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change. The secretariat will continue to analyse the conclusions to determine the exact amount of additional resources required. 169. The Executive Secretary also reminded delegates of his concerns regarding the increase in workload in the context of the loss of value to the core budget as a result of a decline in the United States dollar against the euro. The secretariat will have to rely on voluntary contributions |  not only for supplementary activities |  but also for core activities |  to cover part of the shortfall in the budget. Parties were urged to consider making voluntary contributions to support the process at the earliest opportunity |  to ensure that sufficient and predictable resources are in place to enable the secretariat to undertake all of the required work |  which will include many important activities leading up to COP 15 in Copenhagen. 170. At the same meeting |  the Chair thanked delegates |  the chairs of contact groups and convenors of informal consultations for their contributions. He also thanked the secretariat for its support. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/8 Page 27 Annex I |  |  |  | Text for a draft decision for consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Implementation at its twenty-ninth session Draft decision -/CP.14 Work of the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention |  | The Conference of the Parties |  Recalling the relevant provisions of the Convention |  in particular Article 4 |  paragraphs 1 |  3 and 7 |  [and] Article 12 |  paragraphs 1 |  4 |  5 and 7 |  [and Article 10 |  paragraph 2(a)] |  Recalling decisions 8/CP.5 |  3/CP.8 |  17/CP.8 and 8/CP.11 |  Acknowledging that the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention has made a substantial contribution [to enhancing the capacity of Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (non-Annex I Parties) to improve the process of preparing their national communications] [to improving the process of preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties by providing technical advice and support] |  Reiterating the importance of providing relevant technical advice and support for the [process of] preparation of national communications [and improvement in their quality] |  [Reiterating the importance of providing a forum for non-Annex I Parties to share regional |  subregional and national experiences in the process of preparation of national communications | ] [Acknowledging that the work of the Consultative Group of Experts is related to elements of decision 1/CP.13 (the Bali Action Plan) | ] Recognizing that the preparation of national communications is a continuing process |  1.

In welcoming the participants |  he informed delegates that the Chairman of the SBI |  Mr. Mahmoud Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania) |  was not able to attend this session because of the ill health of a member of his family1. He urged delegates to make efficient use of the time allocated and to conclude the negotiations in a timely manner. He further noted that this was the last session of the SBI before the third session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 3) and |  therefore |  the last opportunity for the SBI to make recommendations for decisions to be adopted by COP 3. 3. The Executive Secretary concurred that the main task of the SBI at its current session |  as was the case for the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technical Advice (SBSTA) |  was to reach consensus on recommendations to COP 3 to enable the latter to focus on the completion of the Berlin Mandate. Reviewing certain matters on the SBI agenda |  he stressed the need of developing countries for support in preparing their initial national communications and in strengthening national capacities to address climate change. In that connection |  he expressed satisfaction at the imminent start-up of a Global Environment Facility (GEF) project to support national communications. The Executive Secretary made known his strong concern at the delays in contributions to the core budget for the current biennium |  including from some major contributors |  and also appealed for further contributions to the Trust Fund for Participation in time for COP 3. He informed the SBI that the Convention secretariat was preparing for the introduction of the new programme structure and was looking forward to future co-operation with the secretariat of the Convention to Combat Desertification |  when it moved to Bonn. |  |  |  | II.

At the 3rd meeting |  on 22 October |  commenting on a proposal to draw up a list of points on which the high-level segment at COP 3 could focus |  including one that would throw light on the “way forward” |  the Executive Secretary sought to distinguish between two types of process that could be carried out after COP 3. The first |  which was still controversial |  was a process opening up the perspective of negotiations of new commitments under the Convention. The second |  which should not be controversial |  was a process that would prepare for the decisions to be taken by the first meeting of the Parties to the protocol or other legal instrument adopted at COP 3.

At the same meeting |  the representative of Japan expressed his Government’s satisfaction that it would now be possible to proceed to conclude final arrangements for the third session of the Conference of the Parties at Kyoto. Japan had hosted a large number of international conferences held under the auspices of the United Nations |  and every effort would be made to ensure the success of the Kyoto Conference. His Government and the people of Japan |  and in |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1997/21 English Page 11 particular the people of Kyoto |  were eagerly awaiting the opportunity to welcome participants to the third session of the Conference of the Parties. 2.

At its 4th meeting |  on 27 October |  the SBI decided to recommend to the Conference of the Parties that the proposed amendments should be taken up in the order in which they had been received by the secretariat. |  |  |  | IX.

Decision --/CP.3 Division of labour between the Subsidiary Body for Implementation and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice |  |  |  | The Conference of the Parties |  Recalling Articles 9 and 10 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |  Recalling also its decision at its second session that the question of the division of labour between the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation should be taken up by the Conference of the Parties at its third session on the basis of recommendations made to it by the Chairmen of the two subsidiary bodies (FCCC/CP/1996/15/Add. 1 |  section III |  4) |  Having considered the recommendations made by the Chairmen |  through the conclusions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation |  as included in the reports of their sixth sessions |  Desiring to elaborate further the division of labour between the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation |  1. Reaffirms that the division of labour is governed by Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention |  and by decision 6/CP.1 and other relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties; 2. Recalls that |  as indicated in decision 6/CP.1 |  the role of the subsidiary bodies can be broadly characterized as follows: (a) The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice will be the link between the scientific |  technical and technological assessments and the information provided by competent international bodies |  and the policy-oriented needs of the Conference of the Parties; (b) The Subsidiary Body for Implementation will develop recommendations to assist the Conference of the Parties in its review and assessment of the implementation of the Convention and in the preparation and implementation of its decisions; |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1997/21 English Page 16 3. Decides that the consideration of issues which are pertinent to both bodies should take place in a way which is efficient in the use of time during meetings |  in order to avoid confusion and to reduce the overall workload. Therefore |  in general |  one of the bodies will take the overall responsibility in considering an issue. If necessary |  it will request adequate and specific inputs from the other body.

In particular |  the SBI was informed by the Executive Secretary that adequate premises could not be made available for the growing secretariat to be accommodated under one roof. The new premises at the UN Campus are expected to be ready by the end of 2011. The secretariat will |  therefore |  be divided over two separate office sites for an estimated period of a year and a half. The SBI was also informed that the new premises to be made available in 2011 would not be able to accommodate the current level of staff |  which may result in the secretariat continuing to operate in two locations.

[Recalling decision 31/CMP.1; |  |  |  | 2. [[The Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) acknowledged that the potential impacts of response measures is a challenge faced by all countries.] [Parties noted that striving to minimize the adverse impacts of mitigation polices and measures is a common concern of both developed and developing countries.] [They further noted that any consideration of these impacts should [initially] focus on the poorest countries and those least able to address those impacts.]] Alt: [Parties noted that striving to minimize the adverse impacts of mitigation policies and measures is an obligation of Parties included in Annex I to the Convention (Annex I Parties) and a concern of developing countries and [emphasizing ][the SBI emphasized ]the commitment of Annex I Parties to minimize adverse social |  environmental and economic impacts of response measures on developing country Parties |  particularly those identified in Article 4 |  paragraphs 8 and 9 |  of the Convention.] 3. [[Recognizing][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]recognized] the special difficulties of those countries |  especially developing countries |  whose economies are particularly dependent on fossil fuel production |  use and exportation[ and/or are faced with serious difficulties in switching to alternatives] |  as a consequence of action taken to limit greenhouse gas emissions.] 4. [[Recognizing][The SBI recognized] that developing country Parties need to be given full consideration as they would have to bear a disproportionate or abnormal burden under the Convention.] 5. [[Considering][Recalling][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]underlined] the importance of the principles outlined in Article 3 of the Convention in the implementation of Article 3 |  paragraph 14 |  [and Article 2 |  paragraph 3 |  ]of the Kyoto Protocol.] 6. [Developed country Parties shall not resort to any form of unilateral measures including countervailing trade measures |  against goods and services imported from developing countries on grounds of protection and stabilization of the climate. Such measures would violate the principles and provisions of the Convention |  including |  in particular |  those related to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (Article 3 |  paragraph 1) |  to trade and climate change (Article 3 |  paragraph 5) |  and to the relationship between mitigation actions of developing countries and the provision of financial resources and technology by developed country Parties (Article 4 |  paragraphs 3 and 7).] Alt: [The SBI [and the SBSTA ]underlined the importance of Article 3 of the Convention in the implementation of Article 3 |  paragraph 14 |  and Article 2 |  paragraph 3 |  of the Kyoto Protocol.] |  |  |  | 52 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/10 |  |  |  | Alt: [Parties |  in the pursuit of the objective and implementation of the Convention |  shall not resort to any measures |  in particular unilateral fiscal or non-fiscal measures applied at the border against goods and services imported from Parties |  that constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustified discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade |  taking into account the relevant provisions of the Convention and further recognizing the principle enshrined in Article 3 |  paragraph 5.] 7. [The SBI [and the SBSTA ]acknowledged the work being carried out by other bodies under the Convention and its Kyoto Protocol |  with the aim of maintaining an approach that is coherent with other relevant work under the UNFCCC process.] 8. [[Emphasizing][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]emphasized] that [developed country ]Parties [included in Annex I to the Convention]shall |  in the implementation of policies and measures |  strive to minimize the adverse effects |  including the adverse effects of climate change |  effects on international trade |  and social |  environmental and economic impacts on other Parties |  especially developing country Parties |  and in particular those identified in Article 4 |  paragraphs 8 and 9 |  of the Convention |  taking into account its Article 3.] 9. [The SBI [and the SBSTA ]noted the need to deepen Parties’ understanding of adverse impacts and the need to continue to share information on the nature of impacts of response measures. Sharing of information can be achieved through the regular and systematic provision by all Parties of information that is as complete as possible on potential and observed impacts of policies and measures |  in particular through [Annex I ]national communications |  and the regular review of this information.] Alt: [[Acknowledging][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]noted ]the need to share information on the nature of adverse impacts of response measures experienced by developing country Parties and the steps Annex I Parties are taking |  in the implementation of policies and measures under Article 2 of the Kyoto Protocol |  to minimize adverse effects |  especially on developing country Parties |  in particular those identified in Article 4 |  paragraphs 8 and 9 |  of the Convention.] Alt: [[Noting][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]]noted the importance of the exchange of information and the development of methodologies on the assessment of adverse social |  environmental and economic impacts on developing country Parties |  particularly those identified in Article 4 |  paragraphs 8 and 9 |  of the Convention.] Option 1: The SBI [and the SBSTA ]also noted the complexities of assessing the attribution and causation of the adverse impacts of policies and measures |  and that understanding of this could be achieved through: (a) Assessments of potential impacts and observed impacts carried out by |  inter alia |  relevant national institutions and international organizations; (b) Information from work being carried out by other UNFCCC bodies that may be relevant in considering potential impacts. Option 2: The SBI [and the SBSTA ]noted the need to deepen the understanding of potential consequences of response measures taken by Annex I Parties on developing country Parties and that this can be achieved through various means including assessments of potential and observed impacts carried out by |  inter alia |  relevant national institutions and international organizations. Option 3: The SBI [and the SBSTA ]noted the complexities of assessing the attribution and causation of the potential impacts of response measures. The SBI [and the SBSTA ]also noted the need to deepen the understanding on the potential impacts of response measures to respond to climate change. This could be achieved through: |  |  |  | 53 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/10 |  |  |  | (a) Assessments of potential impacts and observed impacts carried out by |  inter alia |  relevant national institutions and international organizations; (b) Information from work being carried out by other UNFCCC bodies that may be relevant in considering potential impacts; (c) The regular and systematic provision by all Parties of information that is as complete as possible on potential and observed impacts of policies and measures |  in particular through national communications |  and the regular review of this information. 10. Concerned about the gaps in methodology to incorporate information on actions to minimize the adverse impacts of response measures |  in particular actions related to the areas listed in paragraph 8 of decision 31/CMP.1. 11. The SBI [and the SBSTA ]noted the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on international spillover effects as described in its Fourth Assessment Report |  and [that the IPCC has decided][its plans] to further assess [this issue][and co-benefits and trade-offs] in its Fifth Assessment Report. 12. [The SBI [and the SBSTA ]invited Parties and relevant organizations to submit to the secretariat |  by xx |  further information and views on issues relevant to Article 3 |  paragraph 14[ |  and Article 2 |  paragraph 3 | ] of the Kyoto Protocol |  including views on whether a workshop should be held on this matter |  and on the issues to be dealt with at any such workshop and to compile the submissions into a miscellaneous document.] Alt: [[Invites ][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]also invited] Annex I Parties to submit (by xx) information on the different ways used for reporting on actions to minimize the adverse impacts of response measures |  in particular actions related to the areas listed in paragraph 8 of decision 31/CMP.1 and [requests ][requested ]the secretariat to compile the information submitted above.] 13. [Decides][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]decided ]to work on a road map for a phased approach to the implementation of Article 3 |  paragraph 14 |  of the Kyoto Protocol |  to further its implementation and in accordance with decision 13/CMP.1 |  and to establish a common reporting methodology to incorporate information on actions to minimize the adverse impacts of response measures |  in particular actions related to the areas listed in paragraph 8 of decision 31/CMP.1. The SBI [and the SBSTA ]also decided that the common reporting methodology shall be guided by transparency |  consistency |  comparability |  completeness and accuracy. 14. [Requests][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]requested] the IPCC to develop guidelines to help determine if Parties included in Annex I to the Convention are striving to minimize adverse effects |  including the adverse effects of climate change |  effects on international trade |  and social |  environmental and economic impacts on other Parties |  especially developing country Parties |  and in particular those identified in Article 4 |  paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Convention. 15. [Decides][The SBI [and the SBSTA ]decided] to consider what further actions are necessary to help developing country Parties |  and in particular those identified in Article 4 |  paragraphs 8 and 9 |  of the Convention. Among the issues to be considered shall be the establishment of funding |  insurance and transfer of technology |  pursuant to Article 3 |  paragraph 14. 16.

Opening of the session |  | (Agenda item 1) 1. The twenty-second session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) was held at the Maritim Hotel |  Bonn |  Germany |  from 20 to 27 May 2005. 2. The Chair of the SBI |  Mr. Thomas Becker (Denmark) |  opened the session and welcomed all Parties and observers. He also welcomed Mr. Heorhiy Veremiychyk (Ukraine) |  Vice-Chair of the SBI. Mr. Emilio Sempris (Panama) |  Rapporteur of the SBI |  was unable to attend the session. 3. The Chair invited the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC |  Ms. Joke Waller-Hunter |  to address the SBI. The Executive Secretary indicated that this session was an important opportunity for Parties to close on a number of important political issues on which there was insufficient time to conclude discussions at the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP). This included work on the Least Developed Countries Fund |  the Special Climate Change Fund |  and the submission of national communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (non-Annex I Parties). It was also important to make progress on improving the intergovernmental process. This was the last chance to prepare for the historic first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP). The Executive Secretary informed Parties that the proposal for the programme budget for the biennium 2006–20071 represented the secretariat’s best effort in balancing the budgetary pressures faced by Parties with the level of ambition they have expressed in decisions over the years. In preparing the budget proposal |  the secretariat used the results from the internal review of its activities which |  in the Executive Secretary’s view |  is an exercise worth doing every 10 years or so. In preparation for the eleventh session of the COP |  the secretariat had prepared a proposal for making major UNFCCC meetings climate neutral.2 The Executive Secretary also called upon delegations to contribute to the Trust Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC Process so that the climate change process could continue to benefit from widespread participation from all regions. |  |  |  | II.

At the same meeting |  at the request of the Group of 77 and China |  the Executive Secretary clarified the implications for the work of the secretariat in support of the Parties arising from the reduction of USD 1.75 million compared to her original programme budget proposal. The three key areas of work for the biennium 2006–2007 – adaptation |  support to non-Annex I Parties |  and the infrastructure for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol – will be exempt from any direct impact of the reduced programme budget. This means |  inter alia |  that there will be no impact on the work of the three constituted bodies – the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) |  the LEG and the CGE – or on related work on technology |  or on the work of the clean development mechanism |  joint implementation and compliance. The reduction will have an impact on travel and training of staff; on consultancies for in-depth analytical and specialized work on issues responding to decisions of the COP |  | 29 30 |  |  |  | Adopted as FCCC/SBI/2005/L.5. Bulgaria |  Croatia and Romania supported the statement by the European Community and its member States. 31 Adopted as FCCC/SBI/2005/L.15/Rev.1. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/10 Page 15 and its subsidiary bodies; on the organization of in-depth reviews of national communications from Annex I Parties |  in particular |  on the number of experts funded by the secretariat and the number of in-country reviews; and on policy analysis work. It will also affect the communications work of the secretariat |  including the further development of the content of the web site |  as well as the production and dissemination of information materials. 2. Conclusions 83. The SBI decided to recommend that the COP |  at its eleventh session |  approve a core programme budget of USD 53 | 501 | 583 (EUR 40 | 286 | 693)32 for the biennium 2006–2007. 84.

The SBI decided to recommend a draft decision33 on the programme budget for the biennium 2006–2007 |  including a draft decision on the programme budget for the biennium 2006–2007 as it applies to the Kyoto Protocol |  for adoption by the COP/MOP at its first session |  for adoption by the COP at its eleventh session. 86. The SBI authorized the Executive Secretary to notify Parties of their 2006 contributions |  based on the budget amount shown in paragraph 83 above |  after taking into account the special annual contribution from the Host Government of EUR 766 | 938 and a drawing of USD 1 million (EUR 753 | 000) annually from the unspent balances or contributions (carry-over) from previous financial periods. 87.

He also noted that the GEF will report to the COP |  at its eleventh session |  on progress made towards the implementation of the framework contained in decision 2/CP.7 |  and on how it is responding to decision 2/CP.10. 111. The Chair recalled that the SBI |  at its seventeenth session |  solicited views from Parties on additional priority areas for capacity-building relating to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol |  before the first session of the COP/MOP. These views should be submitted to the secretariat |  by 19 August 2005 |  for compilation into a miscellaneous document and for consideration by the SBI at its twenty-third session (December 2005). Progress on the implementation of decision 1/CP.10 112. The SBI considered progress on the implementation of decision 1/CP.10 under this sub-item at its 3rd meeting |  on 23 May.

At the 5th meeting |  on 27 May |  the Executive Secretary informed the SBI that the conclusions adopted at the twenty-second session would not require additional resources in 2005 that are not covered by the programme budget or under activities identified to be funded from supplementary resources. She reiterated |  however |  that only 42 per cent of the supplementary resources foreseen for the biennium 2004–2005 in the budget decision adopted by the COP at its ninth session have actually been received. 116. The Executive Secretary also informed the SBI that an initial estimate of the possible elements for the provisional agenda of the SBI at its twenty-third session showed that there could be as many as 15 items. In the light of the limited time available to the SBI at its twenty-third session and anticipating the many pressures delegations would face during COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 |  she called for some flexibility in organizing the work of the session. For instance |  as some items on the provisional agenda |  although important in their own right |  do not require specific action at the twenty-third session |  they may not warrant the same amount of time as other items. One option might be that for any item included on |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/10 Page 19 the agenda primarily for information purposes or to take note of on-going work |  the information could be presented to Parties and their views could be heard |  but the establishment of a contact group or the conducting of informal consultations could be deferred until the issue is ready for action and conclusion. The Executive Secretary will consult widely with Parties and propose options to the COP 10 Bureau to ensure that the best use is made of the time in Montreal. 117. Finally |  the Executive Secretary informed the SBI that |  in the context of discussions with the Host Government of COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 regarding the host country agreement for the conference |  the secretariat had been informed that |  according to Canada’s legal system |  it would not be possible to extend privileges and immunities to representatives of observer States and observer organizations. Discussions were continuing with the Government of Canada; Parties and other participants will be informed of the final outcome in the notifications to be sent to Parties and observers on the arrangements for COP 11 and COP/MOP 1. 118. Statements were made by representatives of two Parties |  one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China |  and one on behalf of the European Community and its member States.

The Group of 77 and China also wished to note for the record their disappointment with the lack of progress on the issue of the Special Climate Change Fund. 119. At the same meeting |  the Chair thanked delegates |  the chairs of contact groups and convenors of informal consultations for their contributions. He also thanked the secretariat for its support. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/10 Page 20 Annex I |  |  |  | Draft text for consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Implementation at its twenty-third session (Special Climate Change Fund) |  | The Subsidiary Body for Implementation |  at its twenty-second session |  decided to continue its consideration of issues relating to the Special Climate Change Fund at its twenty-third session (December 2005) |  on the basis of the draft text below. |  |  |  | Draft decision -/CP.11 Further guidance to an entity entrusted with the operation of the financial mechanism of the Convention |  for the operation of the Special Climate Change Fund |  | The Conference of the Parties |  Recalling the relevant provisions of |  in particular |  Article 4 |  paragraphs 1 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  7 |  8 |  9 and 10 |  and Article 11 |  of the Convention |  Recalling also its decisions 4/CP.7 |  5/CP.7 |  7/CP.7 |  7/CP.8 and 5/CP.9 |  Noting the views of Parties on activities |  programmes and measures in the areas listed in decision 7/CP.7 |  paragraph 2 (c) and (d) |  Welcoming the outcome of the first pledging meeting of potential donors to the Special Climate Change Fund and noting that USD 34.6 million has been pledged for that fund |  Recognizing the need for the Global Environment Facility to continue its efforts to mobilize additional resources to support the implementation of eligible project activities under the Special Climate Change Fund |  Acknowledging the work of the Global Environment Facility to operationalize the Special Climate Change Fund | 1 Noting the concerns expressed by most Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention with regard to the operational criteria and policies to be followed in financing activities under the Special Climate Change Fund during an initial five-year period |  which was endorsed by the Global Environment Facility Council in November 2004 |  Noting also the separation between the administration and activities of the Global Environment Facility and the Special Climate Change Fund |  [Noting that activities supported through the Special Climate Change Fund shall take into account national communications or national adaptation programmes of action |  and other relevant information provided by the applicant Party] |  |  |  |  | 1 |  |  |  | As reported in document GEF/C.24/12 “Programming to Implement the Guidance for the Special Climate Change Fund Adopted by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its Ninth Session”. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/10 Page 21 Reiterating that the Special Climate Change Fund should serve as a catalyst to leverage additional resources from bilateral and other multilateral sources |  Reiterating also that activities to be funded should be country-driven |  cost-effective and integrated into national sustainable development and poverty-reduction strategies |  Reiterating further that the provision of support for the implementation of eligible activities under the Special Climate Change Fund shall be consistent with the guidance provided by the Conference of the Parties |  1.

Some Parties stated that such a review must consider action related to the adequacy of Article 4 |  subparagraphs 2 (a) and (b) |  which includes action by all Parties necessary to meet the objective of the Convention. The representative of the Group of 77 and China speaking on behalf of the Group stated that the Conference |  at its fourth session |  must not be distracted from carrying out that review as mandated by the Convention by the introduction of any extraneous matters such as the consideration of new commitments for Parties not included in Annex I; |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1998/6 English Page 14 (e) The SBI considered the timing of future reviews.

It requested the secretariat to compile these views and make them available for its ninth session. VI.

Views were expressed for and against the inclusion of provisional item 6 “Voluntary commitments by non-Annex I Parties” |  the inclusion of which had been requested by a Party. 54. Also at the 8th meeting |  suggestions were made as to possible areas of focus for the high-level segment of the Conference (see FCCC/SBI/1998/MISC.3). 2. Conclusions 55. At its 11th meeting |  on 11 June |  the SBI |  on the recommendation of the Chairman |  adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBI encouraged the secretariat and the host Government to continue their efforts to finalize logistical arrangements for the fourth session of the Conference of the Parties |  and to conclude the host country agreement as soon as possible; (b) The SBI requested the Executive Secretary to take note of the points raised during the meeting when preparing the provisional agenda for COP 4 |  in accordance with rule 9 of the draft rules of procedure of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies being applied; and (c) The SBI recommended that an inaugural ceremony should be scheduled for the afternoon of 11 November 1998 |  and that statements by ministers and other heads of delegation of Parties should be made during the high-level segment on 12 and 13 November. Statements by representatives of observer States and observer organizations would be made to the plenary earlier in the session. It also recommended that all heads of delegation should be accorded equal treatment |  that all drafts and proposals be circulated with sufficient time for consideration and discussion |  and that the high-level segment should be conducted in a transparent manner. B. Calendar of meetings (Agenda item 9 (b)) Proceedings 56. The SBI considered this sub-item at its 7th |  8th and 12th meetings on 5 |  8 and 12 June |  respectively. It had before it document FCCC/SBI/1998/3. 57. Statements were made by representatives of four Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. 58. At the 7th meeting |  on 5 June |  the Executive Secretary presented the SBI with an oral update on this item. He recalled that a calendar of meetings for the period 1998-1999 had been adopted by the COP at its third session (see FCCC/CP/1998/7/Add.1 |  section III |  para. 4). He |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1998/6 English Page 19 also recalled that the General Assembly at its fifty-second session had adopted a resolution requesting that Parties should avoid scheduling meetings in parallel with the General Assembly as of the biennium 2000-2001 (see resolution 52/445 of 18 December 1997). 59. One Party requested that the SBI should adopt a calendar of meetings based on three meetings each year |  consisting of two one-week sessional periods and one two-week sessional period |  the latter of which would include a meeting of the COP. The Executive Secretary informed the SBI that such alteration to the calendar of meetings would have serious impacts on the programme budget and programme of work in the current biennium |  and would also entail a greater need for resources in the Trust Fund for Participation. He noted that changes to the calendar would have to be considered in the light of the availability of United Nations conference services and of meeting facilities in Bonn. 2. Conclusions 60. At its 12th meeting |  on 12 June |  the SBI |  on the recommendation of the Chairman |  after conducting consultations on this sub-item |  adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBI took note of General Assembly resolution 52/445 |  and recommended that the calendar of meetings of the UNFCCC should continue to be based on a 12-month calendar; and (b) The SBI decided to return to the issue of the calendar of meetings for the year 2000 and beyond at its ninth session and prepare a relevant draft decision for consideration and adoption by the COP at its fourth session. It noted that the calendar approved by the Conference of the Parties at its third session (see paragraph 58 above) would apply in 1999. C. Date and venue of the fifth session of the Conference of the Parties (Agenda item 9 (c)) 1. Proceedings 61. The SBI considered this sub-item at its 7th |  8th |  11th and 12th meetings |  on 5 |  8 |  11 and 12 June respectively. It had before it document FCCC/SBI/1998/3. 62. Statements were made by representatives of three Parties. |  |  |  | 63. At the 7th meeting |  on 5 June |  the Executive Secretary informed the SBI that an offer to host the fifth session of the COP (COP 5) had been received from the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. At the 11th meeting |  on 11 June |  the representative of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan confirmed the transmission of the offer |  and expressed the hope that the Conference of the Parties would be in a position to accept it. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1998/6 English Page 20 2. Conclusions 64. At its 12th meeting |  on 12 June |  the SBI |  on the recommendation of the Chairman |  adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBI took note of the generous offer of Jordan and decided to complete its consideration of offers to host COP 5 at its ninth session; (b) The SBI invited any other Party considering making an offer to host COP 5 to communicate such proposal to the secretariat not later than 30 September 1998. D. Volume of documentation (Agenda item 9 (d)) 1. Proceedings 65. The SBI considered this sub-item at its 8th |  11th and 12th meetings |  on 8 |  11 and 12 June respectively. 66. At the 8th meeting |  on 8 June |  the secretariat presented the SBI with an oral report on this sub-item. 67. Also at the 8th meeting |  on 8 June |  a Party recommended that the secretariat should seek to develop and implement a new document distribution system |  in collaboration with the United Nations Office at Geneva |  through which Parties may specify as to whether they would prefer to receive documents only through electronic mail or the World Wide Web |  or if they would prefer to continue to receive printed versions. 2. Conclusions 68. At its 12th meeting |  on 12 June |  the SBI |  on the recommendation of the Chairman |  adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBI took note of the effort by the secretariat to improve the dissemination of official documentation through electronic media |  including the World Wide Web; and (b) The SBI requested the secretariat to continue to improve the electronic dissemination of official documents to Parties |  subject to the availability of funds |  and to make arrangements for provision of official documents in all United Nations languages in electronic format. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1998/6 English Page 21 X. ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS (Agenda item 10) A. Programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999 B. Financial performance in the biennium 1996-1997 C. Financial procedures D. Administrative arrangements (Agenda items 10 (a) to 10 (d)) 1. Proceedings 69. The SBI |  at its 6th meeting |  on 4 June |  considered the information contained in documents FCCC/SBI/1998/4 and FCCC/SBI/1998/INF.4 |  and the oral updates provided by the secretariat. 70. Statements were made by representatives of six Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States. 2. Conclusions 71. At its 12th meeting |  on 12 June |  the SBI |  on the recommendation of the Chairman |  requested the secretariat to incorporate the following conclusions into a draft omnibus decision on administrative and financial matters to be considered by the Conference of the Parties at its fourth session: A. Programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999 72. The SBI endorsed the Executive Secretary’s proposed deployment of the post-Kyoto contingency resources as outlined in document FCCC/SBI/1998/4 |  paragraphs 7-10 |  in particular the increase in the number of additional posts from three to four. The SBI also authorized the Executive Secretary to allocate core budget resources to the Resources Planning and Coordination Programme |  pending the conclusion of negotiations on increased allocations from the overhead payments made to the United Nations |  and to transfer |  as necessary and within the 15 per cent limit |  funds from the budget approved for established posts to temporary assistance. 73. The SBI urged Parties to pay all outstanding contributions to the core budget as soon as possible |  as well as to make timely voluntary contributions to the trust funds for participation and for supplementary activities. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1998/6 English Page 22 B. Financial performance in the biennium 1996-1997 74. The SBI took note of the contributions received for the 1996-1997 biennium under the various sources of funding |  and requested the Executive Secretary to report to COP 4 |  through the SBI at its ninth session |  on the actual expenditures for 1996-1997 |  including audited financial statements and the reports from the internal and external auditors. C. Financial procedures 75. Following the General Assembly resolution to revise the United Nations scale of assessment (resolution 52/215 of 22 December 1997) |  the SBI revisited the modality to be used in determining the indicative scale of contributions to the core budget of the Convention |  on the basis of the alternatives suggested by the Executive Secretary. The SBI decided to recommend to COP 4 that the scale of contributions should be based on the new United Nations scale of assessment and should follow the principle that all Parties should contribute to the Convention budget. To this end |  the SBI also decided to recommend to COP 4 that it should adjust the financial procedures (as contained in decision 15/CP.1 |  annex I |  paragraph 7 (a)) of document FCCC/CP/1995/7/Add.1) to read as follows: “Contributions made each year by Parties on the basis of the indicative scale adopted by consensus by the Conference of the Parties |  and based on such a scale of assessments of the United Nations as may be adopted from time to time by the General Assembly |  adjusted so as to ensure that no Party contributes less than 0.001 per cent of the total; that no one contribution exceeds 25 per cent of the total; and that no contribution from a least developed country Party exceeds 0.01 per cent.” 76. The SBI authorized the Executive Secretary to use this new indicative scale of contributions as a basis for the notification to Parties of their 1999 contributions. This notification should also reflect any credits or debits arising from the application of the new scale to contributions for 1998. D. Administrative arrangements 77. After taking note of the Executive Secretary’s oral report on this sub-item |  the SBI requested the Executive Secretary to continue discussions with the United Nations regarding administrative arrangements for the Convention |  with a view to bringing them to a successful conclusion |  and to inform the Conference of the Parties through the SBI |  as appropriate |  of any significant developments. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1998/6 English Page 23 XI. INVOLVEMENT OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (Agenda item 11) 1. Proceedings 78. The SBI considered this item at its 6th |  9th and 12th meetings |  on 4 |  8 and 12 June |  respectively. It had before it document FCCC/SBI/1998/5. Documents previously issued on this agenda item were also available (FCCC/SBI/1997/14 and Add.1 |  and FCCC/SBI/1997/MISC.7). These documents were introduced by the Executive Secretary. 79. Statements were made by representatives of 11 Parties |  including one representative speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States |  and representatives of two non-governmental organizations |  representing the environmental and the business and industry constituencies |  respectively. 80. Parties stressed the importance of the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) at the meetings of the Convention bodies |  and in the implementation of the Convention. Representatives of non-governmental organizations emphasized their willingness to contribute to the Convention process. The SBI welcomed the practice of the Chairmen of the subsidiary bodies of meeting the different NGO constituencies. 2. Conclusions 81. The SBI |  having considered a proposal by the Chairman |  adopted the following conclusions: (a) The SBI took note that the current arrangements for the accreditation of non-governmental organizations were satisfactory |  and that no change in the accreditation procedures was required; (b) The SBI noted that the existing three recognized constituencies: (i) environmental |  (ii) business and industry |  and (iii) local authorities |  did not always provide a practical way of grouping the non-governmental organizations. The SBI concluded that a new framework could be based on elements provided by the Executive Secretary in document FCCC/SBI/1997/14/Add.1 |  paragraphs 5 and 6 |  as well as on the list of major groups in Agenda 21. In this regard |  the SBI requested the secretariat to continue consultations with representatives of different non-governmental organizations to arrive at an improved set of constituencies |  possibly to be confirmed by the SBI at its tenth session; (c) The SBI recognized that non-governmental organizations |  if they were to be effectively involved in the implementation of the Convention |  must be well informed about the Convention process. The SBI welcomed the proposals of the secretariat for improving the |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1998/6 English Page 24 availability of documentation and information to non-governmental organizations |  and encouraged the secretariat to proceed with those activities |  within the available resources; (d) The SBI noted that representatives of non-governmental organizations (NGO) may be allowed to participate in informal contact groups |  unless the Parties object. 82. The Chairman indicated his understanding |  with respect to paragraph 81 (d) above |  that this provided for the possible participation of NGOs as observers in open-ended contact groups (emphasis added). Different views were expressed on the manner in which participation would be determined. 83. The SBI requested the secretariat to prepare |  for consideration at its ninth session |  a draft decision on the modalities for participation of representatives of NGOs in contact groups for a decision by the COP at its fourth session. XII. REPORT ON THE SESSION (Agenda item 12) 84. At its 12th meeting |  on 12 June |  the SBI approved the draft report on the work of its eighth session |  as contained in document FCCC/SBI/1998/L.1 |  and as orally amended. 85. At the same meeting |  the SBI authorized the Chairman |  with the assistance of the secretariat |  to complete the report on the session. XIII. CLOSURE OF THE SESSION 86. At its 13th meeting |  which was held jointly with the SBSTA on 12 June |  closing statements were made by four Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. 87.

However |  it also noted that a number of these Parties submitted their communications after their due dates; (b) The SBI took note of the national communications and their executive summaries (see document series FCCC/NC/...) |  the second compilation and synthesis report of first national communications from Annex I Parties (FCCC/CP/1996/12 and Add.1 and 2) |  and the available in-depth review reports (FCCC/IDR.1/(country code)); (c) The SBI |  in responding to the request of the President of the Conference of the Parties that it review the implementation of the Convention |  concluded that the above-mentioned documentation contained relevant information allowing Parties to assess the implementation of the Convention by Annex I Parties; |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1996/12 English Page 8 |  |  |  | (d) The SBI concluded that Annex I Parties were fulfilling their commitments under Article 12 by reporting on national policies and measures on the mitigation of climate change and those under Article 4.2(a) to implement those policies and measures |  but according to available information |  for many Annex I Parties |  further urgent action would be needed to return greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by 2000; (e) The SBI concluded that the challenges which Annex I Parties currently face in returning greenhouse gas emissions to their 1990 levels by 2000 |  and the efforts being made to address these challenges |  would be relevant to the AGBM negotiations on commitments for the post-2000 period; (f) The SBI took note of the concern expressed by some Parties that Annex II Parties were falling short of their commitments regarding the transfer of technology and the provision of financial resources |  bearing in mind that other Parties noted that some Annex II Parties were providing bilateral contributions and that all Annex II Parties contributed to the Global Environment Facility |  and noted that Parties were requested to enhance the reporting on these commitments by applying the revised Annex I national communication guidelines; (g) The SBI expressed its appreciation to Annex I Parties that had submitted their national inventory data on emissions by sources and removals by sinks as requested by decision 3/CP.1* and urged those Annex I Parties that had not yet submitted these data to do so as soon as possible; (h) The SBI took note of the information on experience with the review process |  on progress of the in-depth reviews of first national communications from Annex I Parties |  and of suggestions on the scheduling |  submission and review of second communications |  contained in document FCCC/CP/1996/13; (i) The SBI concluded that the review process was a key element for facilitating the implementation of the Convention and monitoring its progress and recommended that this process be continued in accordance with the relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties; (j) The SBI concluded that the question of commitments in Article 4 |  which had been referred to it by the Conference of the Parties at its 4th meeting |  on 12 July |  would be taken up at a future session (FCCC/CP/1996/15 |  para. 51). |  |  |  | * |  |  |  | See document FCCC/CP/1995/7/Add.1. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1996/12 English Page 9 |  |  |  | 15.

The Chair invited the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC |  Mr. Yvo de Boer |  to address the SBI. The Executive Secretary used the occasion of addressing the SBI for the first time since taking office to take stock and to share some of his impressions after eight months in this function |  and to reflect on the challenges ahead. He highlighted the importance for the secretariat to strengthen its cooperation with other United Nations agencies. He also noted the enormous growth in the work to support the project-based mechanisms and the unchartered territory into which emissions trading and the international transaction log (ITL) had taken the secretariat. The Executive Secretary indicated that expectations for the thirteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) and the third session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP) were high |  including the expectation to provide a political answer to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The pressure on the subsidiary bodies to prepare for a smooth conference in Bali was enormous |  with one of the most significant expected outcomes for SBI being an adaptation package. In closing |  the Executive Secretary confirmed the secretariat’s readiness to support the SBI and its Chair as best it could in the work ahead. |  |  |  | II.

In consideration of the report of the Board of Auditors |  the SBI also expressed concern over the outstanding contributions |  particularly those spanning several years |  and strongly urged those Parties that had not yet made their contributions to do so as soon as possible. B. Programme budget for the biennium 2008–2009 (Agenda item 15 (b)) 1. Proceedings 140. The SBI considered this sub-item at its 1st and 5th meetings |  on 7 and 18 May |  respectively.

At the 5th meeting |  Mr. Dovland reported on the contact group’s consultations. |  |  |  | 40 41 |  |  |  | Adopted as FCCC/SBI/2007/L.4. This position was supported by Croatia |  Serbia and The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/15 Page 24 142. At its 5th meeting |  the SBI considered and adopted conclusions42 proposed by the Chair. A representative of Canada stated that Canada fully supported the implementation of the ITL as an integral component of the Kyoto Protocol and was pleased to associate itself with the draft decision subject to fulfilling its domestic budgetary approval procedures. A representative of Mexico stated that Mexico was supportive of the secretariat’s work and the level of the budget |  but in view of the substantive increase of its United Nations scale of assessment |  it would be difficult to pay its contribution to the core budget. 2. Conclusions 143. The SBI decided to recommend that the COP at its thirteenth session approve a core programme budget of USD 54 | 031 | 584 (EUR 41 | 172 | 068) for the biennium 2008–2009. 144. The SBI also decided to propose a contingency budget for conference services amounting to USD 7 | 710 | 600 |  to be added to the programme budget for the biennium 2008–2009 in the event that the United Nations General Assembly decides not to provide resources for these activities in the United Nations regular budget. 145.

At its 5th meeting |  the SBI considered and adopted conclusions45 proposed by the Chair. 2. Conclusions 153. The SBI considered the information contained in document FCCC/SBI/2007/4 and noted the practice of withholding funding to eligible Parties to participate in the UNFCCC process if they have contributions to the core budget outstanding for two years or more. 154. The SBI concluded that this practice has had little effect on the payment of contributions to the core budget and on the number of Parties that have had access to financial support provided by the Trust Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC Process. 155. The SBI requested the secretariat to discontinue this practice and further requested the secretariat to continue to urge Parties through other means |  including issuing reminders |  at each session of the SBI |  to meet their commitments under the core budget.

Statements were made by representatives of three Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the European Community and its member States.47 161. At its 3rd meeting |  the SBI agreed to consider this item in a contact group chaired by Mr. Paul Watkinson (France). At the 5th meeting |  Mr. Watkinson reported on the contact group’s consultations. 162. At its 5th meeting |  the SBI considered and adopted conclusions48 proposed by the Chair. 2. Conclusions 163. The SBI took note of the oral report by the secretariat on actions taken by the Executive Secretary to implement decision 9/CMP.2 |  and expressed its appreciation for the actions taken in response to concerns and issues that have been brought to the attention of the Executive Secretary and the Executive Board of the CDM by legal entities participating in the CDM. 164. The SBI invited the chairs of the constituted bodies established under the Kyoto Protocol to ensure that information on concerns or issues raised regarding a constituted body or individuals serving on the body with regard to their official functions are included in the reports of the constituted body concerned to the CMP. 165. The SBI also took note of the oral report by the secretariat on further work being undertaken to review the legal framework and practice concerning privileges and immunities for bodies of other organizations in the United Nations system |  and the review of the feasibility of insurance to cover the costs associated with claims against individuals serving on constituted bodies established under the Kyoto Protocol |  and requested the secretariat to prepare technical papers on the results of this additional work for consideration by Parties. 166. The SBI recognized that although decision 9/CMP.2 authorizes the Executive Secretary to take action |  inter alia |  to minimize the risks of disputes |  complaints and claims against individuals serving on constituted bodies established under the Kyoto Protocol |  it does not address the underlying issue of immunities for individuals serving on such bodies. 167. The SBI agreed to further consider the need for an effective |  legally sound and long-term solution |  including review procedures |  to ensure that individuals serving on constituted bodies established under the Kyoto Protocol are able to perform their official functions independently and effectively |  on the basis of the experience gained with the implementation of decision 9/CMP.2. 168. The SBI decided to continue its discussion of this issue at its twenty-seventh session |  taking into account the report of the Executive Secretary to the CMP |  at its third session |  in accordance with decision 9/CMP.2 and taking into account the reports to the CMP of the constituted bodies established under the Kyoto Protocol |  documents FCCC/SBI/2006/20 |  FCCC/SBI/2006/21 and |  | 47 48 |  |  |  | This position was supported by Croatia |  Serbia and The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

At its 5th meeting |  on 18 May |  the SBI considered and adopted the draft report on its twenty-sixth session (FCCC/SBI/2007/L.1). At the same meeting |  on a proposal by the Chair |  the SBI authorized the Rapporteur to complete the report on the session |  with the assistance of the secretariat and under the guidance of the Chair. |  |  |  | XVIII. Closure of the session |  | 171. At the 5th meeting |  on 18 May |  the Executive Secretary shared with the SBI a preliminary evaluation of the resource implications of conclusions adopted. This follows decision 16/CP.9 |  paragraph 20 |  which requests the Executive Secretary to provide an indication of the administrative and budgetary implications of decisions if these cannot be met from existing resources within the core budget. The Executive Secretary was pleased to report that there were only a few SBI conclusions with budgetary implications that could not be covered by existing core or supplementary resources in 2007 |  the proposed programme budget for 2008–2009 or the proposed supplementary resources for 2008–2009. The secretariat would further analyse the conclusions and incorporate the requirements in the list of supplementary activities. The Executive Secretary encouraged interested Parties to consider voluntary contributions to those activities and to the Participation Fund that were requested during the twenty-sixth session of the SBI. 172. At the same meeting |  the Chair thanked delegates |  the chairs of contact groups and convenors of informal consultations for their contributions. He paid tribute to Mr. Kishan Kumarsingh |  SBSTA Chair |  and thanked the secretariat for its support.

Mandated events during the thirty-eighth session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation ................................................................................................................ |  |  |  | GE.13-62638 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/10 |  |  |  | I. Background |  | 1. On 17 April 2013 |  the Executive Secretary |  in agreement with the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) |  Mr. Tomasz Chruszczow (Poland) |  issued a provisional agenda for SBI 38 |  which is contained in document FCCC/SBI/2013/1. 2. The Russian Federation |  Belarus and Ukraine |  in communications dated 26 April |  7 May and 15 May 2013 |  respectively |  requested the secretariat to include an agenda item entitled “Procedural and legal issues relating to decision-making by the Conference of the Parties and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol” on the provisional agenda for SBI 38. 3. In accordance with rule 12 of the draft rules of procedure being applied |  and in agreement with the Chair of the SBI |  the supplementary provisional agenda was issued as document FCCC/SBI/2013/1/Add.1 |  which includes the item proposed by Belarus |  Russian Federation and Ukraine as item 19 (see annex I).1 |  |  |  | II. Opening of the session |  | 4. The Chair of the SBI opened SBI 38 on Monday |  3 June |  and welcomed all Parties and observers. He also welcomed Mr. Robert F. Van Lierop (Saint Kitts and Nevis) as Vice-Chair of the SBI and Ms. Mabafokeng F. Mahahabisa (Lesotho) as Rapporteur. The Executive Secretary made a statement. |  |  |  | III. Organizational matters |  | A. Adoption of the agenda |  | 5. At its 1st meeting |  on 3 June |  the SBI considered the note by the Executive Secretary containing the supplementary provisional agenda (FCCC/SBI/2013/1/Add.1). The Chair proposed adopting the agenda as presented in the supplementary provisional agenda. 6. Statements were made by representatives of five Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China and one on behalf of the European Union and its 27 member States and Croatia. 7. The SBI was not able to adopt its agenda |  as there was no consensus on the inclusion of the agenda item proposed by Belarus |  Russian Federation and Ukraine referred to in paragraph 2 above. 8. At the same meeting |  the Chair then proposed launching work on the basis of the supplementary provisional agenda |  while his Vice-Chair would hold consultations in relation to item 19 of the supplementary provisional agenda. That proposal was not supported by all Parties and the meeting was suspended in order to allow for consultations by the Chair and the heads of delegations on how to handle item 19 of the supplementary provisional agenda.2 |  | 1 2 |  |  |  | The proposal from the three Parties was to include it as sub-item 17(a) of the provisional agenda. While work in contact groups and informal consultations could not proceed |  events mandated by a previous session of the Conference of the Parties |  the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol or the SBI to take place in conjunction with SBI 38 were held as planned (see annex II). |  |  |  | 2 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/10 |  |  |  | 9. After those consultations |  the 1st meeting was reconvened |  at which the Chair informed Parties that no agreement had been reached on the way forward. The Chair reiterated his proposal to launch work on the basis of the supplementary provisional agenda while the Vice-Chair would hold consultations on how to deal with the proposal by Belarus |  Russian Federation and Ukraine. 10. Statements were made by representatives of 17 Parties |  including one speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China |  one on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) |  one on behalf of the least developed countries (LDCs) |  one on behalf of the European Union |  one on behalf of the Independent Association for Latin America and the Caribbean |  one on behalf of the African States and one on behalf of the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG). 11. There was no consensus on the way forward |  and the Chair suspended the meeting to allow for extensive informal consultations. 3 A short plenary meeting was convened on Wednesday |  5 June to inform all Parties of the status of the consultations. 4 12. On Friday |  7 June |  the 1st meeting was again reconvened in the morning in order to take stock of the ongoing consultations and to allow the proponents to elaborate on the substantive aspects of their proposal. Representatives of 11 Parties made statements |  including one on behalf of the Group of 77 and China |  one on behalf of the European Union and one on behalf of the EIG. The meeting was suspended in order to allow Parties to engage in further discussions in an informal ‘friends of the Chair’ setting. 5 13. The 1st meeting was ultimately resumed on Tuesday |  11 June. At that meeting |  the Chair provided a comprehensive summary of the consultations and developments since the first plenary meeting on 3 June. He then proposed that the agenda be adopted with item 4(b) held in abeyance and item 19 deleted |  with the understanding that the SBI |  when agreeing on the organization of the work under agenda item 17 |  on arrangements for intergovernmental meetings |  would establish a contact group that would also consider the issues raised by Belarus |  Russian Federation and Ukraine as presented in item 19 of the |  | 3 |  |  |  | 4 |  |  |  | 5 |  |  |  | On the next day |  Tuesday |  4 June |  the Chair and the Vice-Chair held a series of bilateral meetings with interested Parties and groups of Parties. At the end of those meetings |  the Chair and the ViceChair noted that there were some shared views among Parties but no agreement on a solution. On Wednesday |  5 June |  the Chair and the Vice-Chair brought together different Parties in an attempt to forge a mutual understanding and to bring about a solution that would allow the SBI to commence its work. However |  while Parties worked in a constructive spirit |  a compromise appeared to be beyond their reach. Bilateral consultations continued throughout Thursday |  6 June. Late in the afternoon on that day an informal |  open-ended meeting of the SBI was convened in order to allow Parties to further explore the possible areas of convergence in an informal setting. The ‘friends of the Chair’ meeting aimed at finding options paving the way for the adoption of the agenda |  while taking into account the issues raised by Belarus |  Russian Federation and Ukraine. During this informal meeting |  the Chair invited Parties to provide written submissions on the way forward. Two such submissions were subsequently received |  one from the Group of 77 and China and one from the EIG. The ‘friends of the Chair’ meeting was reconvened on Saturday |  8 June by the Vice-Chair |  at which Parties began to discuss the possible text for a statement that would be read by the Chair of the SBI in plenary before the adoption of the agenda |  based on the two submissions received from the Group of 77 and China and the EIG |  respectively. The understanding by the Parties was that the text of the statement would be included in the report of the SBI on the session. However |  Belarus |  Russian Federation and Ukraine stated that although the text was useful |  it could not be considered as their preferred option. The meeting was then suspended and reconvened on Monday |  10 June |  in the morning. As Parties were unable to reach a final agreement |  the meeting was adjourned. In the afternoon |  the Chair and the Vice-Chair held further consultations with the Russian Federation and Ukraine |  which then handed over a formal submission with their preferred options for a solution to how to handle their proposal. None of these options |  however |  led to a resolution of the issue. 3 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/10 |  |  |  | supplementary provisional agenda. The adoption of the agenda was objected to by those three Parties. 14. Representatives of 28 Parties made statements |  including one on behalf of the Group of 77 and China |  one on behalf of the EIG |  one on behalf of the European Union |  one on behalf of the LDCs |  one on behalf of the African States and one on behalf of AOSIS. 15. A final attempt was made by the Chair to propose the agenda for adoption |  but there was again no consensus on the proposal. A statement was made by the Executive Secretary before the Chair adjourned the meeting and invited Parties to reconvene in plenary on Friday |  14 June for the 2nd meeting of the SBI in order to close the session. |  |  |  | B. |  |  |  | Closure of the session |  | 16. At the closing plenary meeting |  held on 14 June |  representatives of 15 Parties made statements |  including one on behalf of the Group of 77 and China |  one on behalf of the EIG |  one on behalf of the European Union |  one on behalf of the LDCs |  one on behalf of the African States |  one on behalf of AOSIS |  one on behalf of the Independent Association for Latin America and the Caribbean and one on behalf of three Parties with economies in transition. Three representatives of non-governmental organizations also made statements on behalf of environmental non-governmental organizations and youth non-governmental organizations. 17. In addition |  the Government of Peru |  the host proposed by Latin America and Caribbean States for the twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties and the tenth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol |  delivered a video message to the plenary. While in most of their statements Parties expressed regret that the SBI could not launch its work at this session |  they also expressed support for the work of the SBI Chair and the Vice-Chair during the session in facilitating the negotiations by the Parties and looked forward to a productive thirty-ninth session in Warsaw |  Poland |  in November. 18. Before closing the meeting |  the Chair thanked all Parties and observer organizations and invited them to look forward to SBI 39 |  at which he expects Parties to work in a new spirit of compromise |  trust |  openness and understanding. |  |  |  | 4 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/10 |  |  |  | Annex I |  | Supplementary provisional agenda |  | 1. 2.

The division of labour is governed by Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention |  and by decisions 6/CP.1 |  and other relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties. 2. As indicated in decision 6/CP.1 |  the role of the subsidiary bodies can be broadly characterized as follows: (a) The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice will be the link between the scientific |  technical and technological assessments and the information provided by competent international bodies |  and the policy-oriented needs of the Conference of the Parties; and (b) The Subsidiary Body for Implementation will develop recommendations to assist the Conference of the Parties in its review and assessment of the implementation of the Convention and in the preparation and implementation of its decisions. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1997/16 English Page 20 |  |  |  | 3. The consideration of issues which are pertinent to both bodies should take place in a way which is efficient in the use of time during meetings |  to avoid confusion and to reduce the overall workload. Therefore |  in general |  one of the bodies will take the overall responsibility in considering an issue. If necessary |  it will request adequate and specific inputs from the other body. Where overall responsibility is not assigned |  agendas should be organized to ensure that the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation avoid dealing with such issues in parallel sessions. On issues where this is not possible |  consideration should be given to holding ad-hoc joint sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation. On this basis |  the provisions above are clarified as follows: |  |  |  | I. National communications from Parties 4. The Subsidiary Body for Implementation will have the overall responsibility for: |  |  |  | (a) Developing guidelines on the processes for consideration of national communications; (b) Considering the information contained in national communications |  other relevant documentation and compilation and synthesis reports |  with a view to assisting the Conference of the Parties in undertaking its tasks under Article 7.2(e). 5. In co-operation with the Subsidiary Body for Implementation |  the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice will have responsibility for: (a) Developing guidelines for the provision of comparable information |  including all related methodological issues; and (b) Considering |  upon the request of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation |  as appropriate |  national communications and other relevant documentation |  such as technical papers |  with the aim of |  inter alia |  verifying methodologies used and making recommendations on their refinement; preparing scientific assessments on the effects of measures taken in the implementation of the Convention; reviewing projections and their assumptions; and assessing comprehensiveness and effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation measures. |  |  |  | II. Development and transfer of technology 6. The Subsidiary Body for Implementation will |  with input from the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice as appropriate |  have responsibilities for assisting the Conference of the Parties in the assessment and review of the effective implementation of the Convention with respect to the development and transfer of technology. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1997/16 English Page 21 |  |  |  | 7. As stipulated in the Convention |  and as decided by the Conference of the Parties in decision 6/CP.1 |  the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice will have responsibility for providing advice on all scientific |  technological and methodological aspects of the development and transfer of technology. |  |  |  | III. Consultations with non-governmental organizations 8. Taking into account the competence of each subsidiary body |  the Subsidiary Body for Implementation will have overall responsibility for all policy questions and relevant inputs related to issues dealing with consultation with non-governmental organizations |  as appropriate. 9. Should the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice or any other subsidiary body feel that non-governmental organizations could provide relevant input on an item being considered |  that body could seek and consider such inputs. 10. Provisional accreditation related to individual non-governmental organizations will be the responsibility of the relevant body involved. |  |  |  | IV. Activities implemented jointly 11. The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice will have the responsibility for: (a) Developing the framework for reporting |  including consideration of scientific |  technical and methodological aspects of the reports; and (b) Preparing a synthesis report of activities for the Conference of the Parties. 12. The Subsidiary Body for Implementation will have the responsibility for: |  |  |  | (a) Assisting the Conference of the Parties with reviewing the progress of the activities implemented jointly under the pilot phase |  on the basis of inputs by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1997/16 English Page 22 |  |  |  | V. Research and systematic observation 13. In accordance with Article 5 of the Convention |  the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice will have the overall responsibility for issues related to research and systematic observation |  drawing |  where necessary |  upon the Subsidiary Body for Implementation. The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice shall also play a co-ordination role in such activities related to climate change relevant to the implementation of the Convention. 14. The Subsidiary Body for Implementation |  with input from the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice as appropriate |  will have the responsibility for assisting the Conference of the Parties in the assessment and review of the effective implementation of the Convention |  with respect to research and systematic observation. |  |  |  | VI. Education |  training and public awareness 15. In further clarification to decision 6/CP.1 |  the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice will have the overall responsibility in providing advice on educational |  training |  and public awareness programmes |  as well as public access to information. When considering such issues |  the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice will draw upon |  inter alia |  relevant international organizations. 16. The Subsidiary Body for Implementation |  with input from the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice as appropriate |  will have responsibility for assisting the Conference of the Parties in the assessment and review of the effective implementation of the Convention with respect to education |  training |  and public awareness. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/1997/16 English Page 23 |  |  |  | Annex III ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS: PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR 1998-1999 Draft decision for the COP |  |  |  | The Conference of the Parties |  Recalling paragraph 4 of the financial procedures for the Conference of the Parties |  Having considered the proposed budget for the biennium 1998-1999 submitted by the Executive Secretary (FCCC/SBI/1997/10) |  Noting the annual contribution of the host Government |  DM 1.5 million |  which offsets planned expenditures |  1.

The SBI expressed its gratitude to the Governments of Australia |  Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for their financial contributions to the development of training materials and for supporting the participation of developing country experts at the above-mentioned workshop. 24. The SBI welcomed the report of the CGE |  contained in document FCCC/SBI/2006/4 |  on the outcomes of its examination of 41 initial national communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (non-Annex I Parties). It acknowledged that the report was useful in providing information on the scope of activities of non-Annex I Parties relating to national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories |  vulnerability and adaptation assessments |  mitigation assessments and cross-cutting themes |  and in identifying gaps and constraints in preparing national communications. It urged Parties and bilateral |  multilateral and international organizations to take into account the recommendations contained in document FCCC/SBI/2006/4. 25. The SBI commended the CGE for its important work in providing technical advice on ways to improve the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I Parties. It requested the group |  consistent with its mandate contained in the annex to decision 3/CP.8 |  to examine the national communications submitted to the secretariat from 2 April 2005 and to prepare a report for consideration by the SBI at its twenty-seventh session (December 2007). It also urged those non-Annex I Parties that have not yet submitted their initial national communications to do so as soon as possible. 26. The SBI requested the CGE |  in consultation with the GEF–NCSP of the UNDP/UNEP |  and other relevant organizations |  to advise the SBI at its twenty-fifth session (November 2006) on the provision of technical assistance to non-Annex I Parties upon request in identifying tools and methods needed |  in the context of the preparation of national communications and which are applicable to their particular circumstances. 27. The SBI endorsed the efforts of the CGE to develop a template on cross-cutting themes (transfer of technologies |  research and systematic observation |  capacity-building |  education |  training and public awareness |  and information and networking) to assist non-Annex I Parties in providing information under the section on “other information considered relevant to the achievement of the objective of the Convention” in national communications |  and invited the group to report to the SBI at its twenty-sixth session (May 2007). The SBI encouraged the CGE to cooperate with the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) and the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) in the development of this template. 28. The SBI requested the CGE to take stock of the implementation of its work programme 2003–2007 and to identify possible elements for a future role for the group in facilitating the improvement of national communications of non-Annex I Parties and to report to the SBI at its twenty-sixth session. It also invited Parties to submit to the secretariat |  by 15 August 2007 |  their views on the mandate and terms of reference of the CGE |  and requested the secretariat to compile these views into a miscellaneous document for consideration by the SBI at its twenty-seventh session. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2006/11* Page 9 29. The SBI noted that only part of the resources required for conducting the hands-on training workshops on vulnerability and adaptation assessment for the Latin America and the Caribbean region |  to be held in Asuncion |  Paraguay |  in August 2006 |  and on national GHG inventories for the Africa region |  to be held in Warmbaths |  South Africa |  in September 2006 |  has been raised. It invited Parties included in Annex II to the Convention |  and other Parties included in Annex I to the Convention in a position to do so |  to provide financial resources for these workshops as soon as possible. B. Compilation and synthesis of initial national communications (Agenda item 4 (b)) 1. Proceedings 30.

The SBI noted that although the preparation of national communications has provided a valuable opportunity for capacity-building |  inter alia |  in the area of national GHG inventories |  vulnerability and adaptation |  and mitigation |  the enhancement of capacity and support for the maintenance of such capacity is important. 35. The SBI expressed its appreciation of the fact that non-Annex I Parties are continuing to fulfil their commitments under Article 4 |  paragraph 1 |  and Article 12 |  paragraph 1 |  of the Convention. It urged those non-Annex I Parties that had not yet submitted their initial national communications to do so as soon as possible.

Conclusions 40. The SBI took note of document FCCC/SBI/2006/INF.1 and welcomed the information made available by the GEF on the financial support provided for the preparation of initial and subsequent national communications from non-Annex I Parties. It invited the GEF to continue to provide information on activities of non-Annex I Parties relevant to the status of the preparation of their national communications. It also looked forward to receiving |  in addition to the dates of approval |  information on the dates of disbursement of funds |  and requested the secretariat to report this information to the SBI at its twenty-fifth session (November 2006). 41. The SBI expressed its appreciation for the technical assistance provided by the GEF–NCSP |  and bilateral and multilateral agencies |  to non-Annex I Parties for the preparation of national communications.

Conclusions 98. The SBI welcomed the report on activities relating to the review of initial reports submitted in accordance with decision 13/CMP.1.48 99. The SBI acknowledged the commendable effort made by Parties and experts |  supported by the secretariat |  that made it possible to conduct 36 reviews of the initial reports in 2007 in conjunction with the reviews of the 2006 greenhouse gas inventory submissions under the Convention and to publish the corresponding reports under established deadlines. However |  it noted that the review process needs further strengthening |  in particular through the participation of an increased number of well-trained review experts and more support from the secretariat |  to continue with the review procedures established by the “Guidelines for review under Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol”. 100. The SBI noted the importance of the training programme under the Kyoto Protocol. The SBI requested the secretariat to update and complement the training programme |  in particular in relation to the review of activities under Article 3 |  paragraphs 3 and 4 |  the review of national registries and the review of information on assigned amounts |  in particular the standard electronic format tables. The SBI encouraged Parties in a position to do so to provide the necessary funding for these activities. 101. The SBI also noted the need for consistent implementation of the technical guidance on adjustments in the reviews of inventory submissions under the Kyoto Protocol. The SBI requested the lead reviewers to consider this issue at their next meeting. 102. The SBI acknowledged that |  in accordance with decision 22/CMP.1 |  Annex I Parties may start reporting on a voluntary basis information under Article 7 |  paragraph 1 |  with the inventory submission due under the Convention from the year following the submission of the initial report |  and that this information shall be reviewed in accordance with the “Guidelines for review under Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol”. 103. The SBI noted with concern the high volume of work in 2008 related to the reviews of the national communications |  the rescheduled reviews of 2007 inventory submissions and the forthcoming reviews of 2008 inventory submissions |  including the annual review of supplementary information submitted in accordance with Article 7 |  paragraph 1 |  on a voluntary basis. This will place considerable pressure on |  and demand for resources from |  the Parties |  review experts and the secretariat. 104. The SBI also noted that |  in accordance with the conclusions of the CMP at its second session | 49 there is a need for flexibility in the timing of review activities for the 2007 inventory submissions and that the review of the 2007 inventory submissions should be conducted in conjunction with the review of the 2008 inventory submissions |  with a focus on the most recent submissions. The SBI requested the lead reviewers to consider this issue at their next meeting and to make recommendations on how to implement this flexibility. 105. The SBI further noted specific issues for expert review teams conducting reviews of inventories under the Kyoto Protocol |  including the deadlines established under Article 8 |  the amount of information to review |  the correction of problems identified during the reviews and the calculation of any adjustments during the review. It acknowledged the need for a continued assessment of these issues in future |  with a view to identifying options to manage these issues. The SBI reiterated the need for continued analysis of the effectiveness of the review process under Article 8 in implementing decisions 12/CP.9 and 22/CMP.1. |  |  |  | 48 49 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/INF.10.
