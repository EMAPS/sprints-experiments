Mandate |  | 1. The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by its decision 29/CP.7 |  established the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) to advise on the preparation and implementation strategy for national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) |  and adopted the terms of reference of the LEG. According to these terms of reference |  the LEG is to convene twice each year |  and report on its work to the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI). 2. In response to decision 8/CP.13 |  the LEG developed |  at its thirteenth meeting |  a work programme for 2008–2010 | 1 which was considered by the SBI at its twenty-eighth session. The SBI |  at its thirtieth session |  requested the LEG to keep it informed of the efforts of the LEG in implementing its work programme over the period 2008–2010.2 |  |  |  | II. Summary of the sixteenth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | A. Proceedings 3. The sixteenth meeting of the LEG was held in Bangkok |  Thailand |  from 24 to 26 September 2009. 4. The COP |  by its decision 8/CP.13 |  decided that the LEG may invite |  when deemed necessary |  the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its agencies to its meetings. Furthermore |  the SBI |  at its twentyeighth session | encouraged the LEG to seek to ensure the complementarity of its activities under its work programme with related efforts by the GEF |  its agencies and other relevant entities.3 To this end |  representatives of the GEF and five of its agencies – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |  the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) |  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |  the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Bank – participated in the sixteenth meeting. 5. During the meeting |  the LEG focused its work on the following: reviewing the status of NAPA preparation and implementation (see chapter II B below); considering priority activities of the LEG work programme (see chapter II C below); considering the documentation of the implementation of NAPAs (see chapter II D below); considering lessons learned in the NAPA process (see chapter II E below) |  and reviewing progress on the implementation of priority activities contained in its work programme for 2008–2010 and identification of priorities for 2010 (see chapter III below). B. Status of preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 6. On the status of preparation of NAPAs |  as at 30 September 2009 |  43 NAPAs had been submitted to the secretariat |  and the representative of the GEF reported that five of the 48 least developed countries (LDCs) that have received funding for the preparation of NAPAs had yet to submit completed NAPAs |  but most of these were at an advanced stage of preparation. |  |  |  | 1 2 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/6 |  annex I. FCCC/SBI/2009/8 |  paragraph 59. 3 FCCC/SBI/2008/8 |  paragraph 47. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2009/13 Page 4 7. On the status of implementation of NAPAs |  the GEF reported on NAPA projects under its consideration. As at 24 September 2009 |  nine projects in Bangladesh |  Bhutan |  Burkina Faso |  Cambodia |  Cape Verde |  Eritrea |  Niger |  Samoa and Sudan had received endorsement by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the GEF |  and at least 12 projects in Benin |  Democratic Republic of the Congo |  Djibouti |  Gambia |  Guinea |  Lesotho |  Mali |  Rwanda |  Sierra Leone |  Tuvalu |  Vanuatu and Zambia are expected to be endorsed by the CEO of the GEF before the end of 2009. Twelve project identification forms (PIFs) have been approved by the CEO of the GEF and the GEF Council from Comoros |  Guinea-Bissau |  Haiti |  Kiribati |  Lao People’s Democratic Republic |  Liberia |  Malawi |  Mali |  Maldives |  Mauritania |  Sao Tome and Principe |  and Yemen |  and two more PIFs are pending clearance by the CEO and approval by the GEF Council. 8. Five countries have submitted a NAPA and are preparing PIFs (Central African Republic |  Madagascar |  Mozambique |  Senegal and Solomon Islands) |  and four countries have yet to start preparation of a PIF in cooperation with a GEF agency (Afghanistan |  Ethiopia |  Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania). 9. As at 24 September 2009 |  in terms of the distribution of funds committed under the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) for the 33 approved projects |  the GEF reported that 67 per cent of the projects are in Africa |  30 per cent are in Asia |  and 3 per cent are in the Pacific and Caribbean. Forty-two per cent of the projects are agriculture and food security projects |  27 per cent are vulnerability and risk management projects |  24 per cent are coastal management projects and 6 per cent are water management projects. 10. The following GEF agencies are currently supporting the implementation of NAPA projects: UNDP (supporting the implementation of 21 NAPA projects) |  World Bank (4) |  UNEP (3) |  IFAD (2) |  the African Development Bank (1) |  and UNDP and UNEP jointly (1). 11. The representative of the GEF informed the LEG that an adjustment was made to the LDCF based on available resources. Prior to June 2009 |  LDC Parties were able to access up to USD 3.6 million from the LDCF to fund NAPA projects |  but since then LDC Parties have been able to access up to USD 5 million. Currently |  there are no specific instructions for accessing the additional funds in cases where an LDC Party has already had access to USD 3.6 million under the LDCF. The representative indicated that an LDC Party can either submit a new proposal to access the additional funds |  or if it is still in the process of developing its first project |  it can adjust its application for funding accordingly. C. Consideration of priority activities of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group 1. Enhanced support to countries in the preparation stage 12. The LEG discussed the progress made by several of the countries that are still preparing NAPA projects and agreed to continue to identify and resolve problems as they arise. Members of the LEG were assigned to follow the specific cases of Nepal |  Timor-Leste and Angola to ensure that any remaining obstacles are removed and that resource materials are provided to the NAPA teams as they carry out their work. It was agreed that a case file be opened and maintained for each of these cases. 2. Guidance to least developed country Parties for revising projects and project lists 13. As part of its work programme and in response to an invitation by the SBI at its twenty-ninth session | 4 the LEG has developed a set of recommendations on how LDC Parties can update priorities in NAPAs |  which would lead to revisions to the list of projects and project profiles. These |  | 4 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/19 |  paragraph 58. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2009/13 Page 5 recommendations are contained in annex I to this report. Information on updating priorities in NAPAs is presented in a technical paper5 that the LEG has prepared to offer additional guidance to LDC Parties for the preparation and design of implementation strategies for NAPAs. The technical paper provides guidance to NAPA teams on the preparation of an implementation strategy as well as a set of key criteria and areas of importance for the reassessment by LDC Parties of their adaptation needs over time. The recommendations on updating NAPAs are also included in the Step-by-Step Guide for Implementing NAPAs (hereinafter referred to as the step-by-step guide).6 3. Completion and distribution of the Step-by-Step Guide for Implementing National Adaptation Programmes of Action 14. During the stocktaking meeting in 2007 the LEG took note of a request for it to develop guidance on implementation of NAPAs |  to assist NAPA teams to navigate information requirements in preparing project proposals for funding by the GEF and other sources |  and to provide easily accessible answers to common questions about technical aspects of project development. As a result |  the LEG proposed at its thirteenth meeting that a step-by-step guide for the implementation of NAPAs be prepared.7 15. The LEG distributed a questionnaire among LDC Parties at the twenty-eighth session of the SBI on the status and preparation of NAPAs |  in accordance with its work programme. At the fourteenth meeting of the LEG |  the LEG and representatives of the GEF discussed the issues that arose from this questionnaire and agreed to explore the possibility of publishing a “Quick Guide” to accessing the LDCF.8 16. At its sixteenth meeting |  the LEG |  working in close collaboration with the GEF |  decided to incorporate the Quick Guide into the step-by-step guide making it a single publication. This would ensure that LDC Parties receive consistent guidance on developing NAPA projects and would facilitate collaboration between the agencies of the GEF and the LEG and the GEF when responding to requests by the SBI for technical support and training.9 The step-by-step guide is currently available in English |  and French and Portuguese translations are being prepared. The guide was distributed to participants at the first training workshop on implementing NAPAs that took place on 19–23 October 2009 in the United Republic of Tanzania. 4. Training on the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 17. The LEG discussed plans for a comprehensive training plan aimed at strengthening the capacity of experts from LDC Parties to design and implement NAPA projects effectively. A series of regional training workshops have been planned between October 2009 and July 2010 |  which are to be organized with the assistance of regional centres and regional experts |  as well as regional officers of GEF agencies. The LEG reviewed the training materials that had been prepared by a consultant and considered inputs and comments from the GEF and its agencies. The revised set of training materials |  along with the stepby-step guide |  were used in the first training workshop in October 2009 in the United Republic of Tanzania. 18. Thirteen LDC Parties have been invited to the first training workshop. A maximum of three participants from each LDC Party attended. Feedback received during and after the workshop will be used to enhance future workshops. An evaluation of the training workshops is also planned. |  | 5 6 |  |  |  | <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/ldc_tp2009.pdf>. UNFCCC. 2009.

The rest of the training workshops are planned for the first half of 2010 |  subject to the availability of funds. The LEG is currently consulting with host countries to finalize dates. 5. Outreach on national adaptation programmes of action 20. The LEG launched several outreach products |  including:10 (a) (b) A brochure on matters relating to LDCs under the Convention (available in hard copy and electronically); A technical paper entitled ‘Overview of preparation |  design of implementation strategies and submission of revised project lists and profiles’ |  which is part of the contribution of the LEG towards the work of the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change (available in hard copy and electronically); An enhanced web page called the Least Developed Countries portal; A list of frequently asked questions (available electronically). 6. Support needed to fully implement national adaptation programmes of action 21. The LEG considered a working paper on support needed to fully implement NAPAs. Information contained in NAPAs submitted to the secretariat |  project documents for NAPA implementation submitted to the GEF and other relevant information available as at 24 September 2009 was used to evaluate the type and level of support needed to fully implement NAPAs. The paper discussed needs for technology and scientific |  human and institutional capacities at the local level to allow NAPAs to be implemented fully. The LEG decided to finalize the paper and disseminate it at the thirtieth session of the SBI and the fifteenth session of the COP. 7. Approach for the assessment of the least developed countries work programme |  in particular the process for national adaptation programmes of action 22. The LEG took note of mandates for the assessment of the NAPA process |  access to the LDCF and for the implementation of the LDC work programme.11 As part of the activity in its work programme to develop an approach paper on assessing the NAPA process and the implementation of NAPAs |  the LEG discussed the possibility of producing such a paper and the proposed terms of reference for conducting various assessments for consideration by the SBI at its thirty-first session. The draft terms of reference are included in annex III. D. Documenting the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 23. The LEG noted the various efforts made to implement NAPAs in addition to the projects being developed under the GEF and/or the LDCF. Programmes that are implementing activities identified in NAPAs in LDCs include the World Bank Pilot Programme for Climate Resilience |  the Africa Adaptation Programme under the UNDP and funded by the Government of Japan |  the Global Climate Change Alliance of the European Union and bilateral programmes |  as well as national efforts. The LEG discussed the need to compile accurate information on the specific aspects of NAPAs that are being addressed outside of the GEF and/or the LDCF |  and to include such information in the data compiled and analysed by the GEF on the implementation of NAPAs. |  |  |  | (c) (d) |  |  |  | 10 11 |  |  |  | These electronic resources are available on the Least Developed Countries portal at <www.unfccc.int/ldc>. Decision 5/CP.14 |  paragraphs 4 |  5 and 10. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2009/13 Page 7 24. The LEG decided on an approach that includes contacting relevant agencies and programmes to ask for information on the ways in which they are assisting in the implementation of NAPAs. The LEG will continue to conduct surveys with United Nations agencies in order to collect such information. E. Lessons learned in the national adaptation programme of action process 25. During the discussions with the GEF and its agencies |  it was noted that there are many useful lessons to be learned in the NAPA process regarding addressing adaptation. It was also noted that the regional training workshops provide an additional opportunity to collect more experience and lessons learned from experts from LDC Parties. The LEG decided to enhance efforts to capture lessons and good practice |  and to produce a publication in 2010 that will communicate these lessons. The LEG will collaborate with the GEF and its agencies and other relevant stakeholders during the production of this publication. |  |  |  | III. Progress on priority activities for implementation for 2008–2009 and priority activities for 2010 |  | 26. In response to a request by the SBI at its twenty-eighth session | 12 the LEG considered which activities in its work programme for 2008–2010 should be given priority. A list of priority activities is presented in annex I to document FCCC/SBI/2008/14. At its sixteenth meeting |  the LEG reviewed progress made in implementing its work programme and identified a list of additional actions needed in 2010 |  which is contained in annex II to this document. |  |  |  | 12 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/8 |  paragraph 50. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2009/13 Page 8 Annex I |  |  |  | Recommendations to least developed country Parties on updating priorities in national adaptation programmes of action and on revising projects and project profiles |  | 1. The main steps in developing national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) are given in the annotated guidelines for the preparation of NAPAs | 1 prepared by the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) |  and include guidance on periodically reviewing risks and prioritizing activities. Given that it has been some time since the first NAPAs were completed |  the LEG has identified the following reasons for updating or revising a NAPA |  including: (a) Priority NAPA activities may have been implemented using bilateral funding or funding from other sources and technical cooperation |  therefore the remaining priorities for which funding would be sought under the Least Developed Countries Fund may need to be revised; In cases where only brief information has been provided on costs and details for implementation |  a least developed country (LDC) Party may decide to provide revised cost information and/or additional project profile information; In some cases |  new risks and vulnerabilities may have become evident and the ranking of the urgent and immediate priorities in the NAPA may need to be revised |  especially in cases when the NAPA was completed a year or more previously; There may be a need to incorporate lessons learned from the implementation of NAPAs by other LDCs; There may be a need to address additional information requirements in order to meet new project development guidelines |  such as information required under the current guidelines for project development (using the project identification form (PIF) instead of the previous project development fund window that was in use when some of the earlier NAPAs were prepared); There may be a need to provide simple revisions to the NAPA |  such as details of revised costing of project activities |  following the availability of new information. Information that would facilitate the preparation of PIFs could be added. Some Parties may choose to explain how a major project activity could be integrated into sector-wide plans. |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | (d) (e) |  |  |  | (f) |  |  |  | 2. The LEG proposes that LDC Parties use the following process and simple steps when preparing revisions to their NAPAs: (a) Reviewing the NAPA and identifying the reason and starting point for the update. LDC Parties could review their NAPA and assess whether an update is warranted based on the reasons contained in paragraph 1 above. Those Parties interested in updating or revising their NAPA should identify an starting point for the update; Reconvening a multi-stakeholder steering group to consider the updates. It is likely that most countries will reconvene a NAPA steering group to compile updated information on the risks and status of the implementation of existing NAPA priorities. The group will reconsider the priorities and create a new list of priority activities and |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | 1 |  |  |  | <http://unfccc.int/files/cooperation_and_support/ldc/application/pdf/annguide.pdf>. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2009/13 Page 9 updated project profiles as appropriate. The NAPA steering group will then prepare a revised implementation strategy; (c) Endorsing the revised NAPA and the submission of the update to the secretariat. Once the relevant updates have been prepared |  it will be necessary for a formal submission to be endorsed by the relevant authorities at the national level |  such as a national climate change coordination committee. Once the NAPA has been endorsed |  the update will be submitted to the secretariat by the national focal point |  clearly indicating the nature of the update in a covering letter. The covering letter and the document containing the update will become an addendum to the NAPA; Post-processing the update. Upon receipt |  the secretariat will update the records on the UNFCCC website and inform the Global Environment Facility and its agencies that an update has been submitted. The secretariat will then update the online database of NAPA projects in order to include the updated information; Analysing NAPAs. The LEG will analyse the information submitted by Parties in NAPAs and through the databases of implemented projects and subsequent updates |  and provide reports to the Subsidiary Body for Implementation to guide further discussions by all Parties on the progress made with the NAPA programme. |  |  |  | (d) |  |  |  | (e) |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2009/13 Page 10 |  |  |  | Annex II |  |  |  | Updated priority activities of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2010 |  | Activity Enhance efforts to support least developed countries (LDCs) with special needs with regard to the preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) |  | a |  |  |  | Progress made Ongoing.

Mandate |  | 1. The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by its decision 29/CP.7 |  established the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) to advise on the preparation and implementation strategy for national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) |  and adopted the terms of reference of the LEG. According to these terms of reference |  the LEG is to convene twice each year |  and report on its work to the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI). 2. In response to decision 8/CP.13 |  the LEG developed |  at its thirteenth meeting |  in Sana’a |  Yemen |  a work programme for 2008–2010 | 1 which was considered by the SBI at its twenty-eighth session. The SBI |  at its twenty-ninth session |  requested the LEG to report on progress made in the implementation of its work programme at the thirtieth session of the SBI.2 |  |  |  | II. Summary of the fifteenth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | A. Proceedings 3. The fifteenth meeting of the LEG was hosted by the Government of Benin and held in Cotonou from 3 to 5 March 2009. 4. By its decision 8/CP.13 |  the COP decided that the LEG may invite the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its agencies to its meetings. Furthermore |  the SBI |  at its twenty-eighth session | 3 encouraged the LEG to seek to ensure the complementarity of its work programme activities with related efforts by the GEF |  its agencies and other relevant entities. To this end |  representatives of the GEF and three of its agencies – the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |  the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Bank – participated in the fifteenth meeting. 5. During the meeting |  the LEG focused its work on the following: reviewing the status of NAPA preparation and implementation (see chapter II B below); considering efforts to support least developed countries (LDCs) in implementing NAPAs (chapter II C); reviewing progress on priority activities for implementation (chapter III); and reviewing progress on priority activities of its work programme for 2008–2010 (annex I). The LEG also held an interactive session with Benin’s NAPA team (chapter II D). B. Status of preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 6. On the status of preparation of NAPAs |  the GEF representative reported that |  as at 3 March 2009 |  nine of the 48 LDCs that have received funding to prepare NAPAs had yet to submit their completed NAPAs to the UNFCCC secretariat. However |  most of these NAPAs are at an advanced stage of preparation. 7. On the status of implementation of NAPAs |  the GEF reported on NAPA projects under consideration by the GEF. As at 3 March 2009 |  three projects |  in Bangladesh |  Bhutan and Samoa |  had received endorsement of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the GEF |  while 22 project identification forms (PIFs) had been approved by the CEO and the GEF Council (from Benin |  Burkina Faso |  Cambodia |  Cape Verde |  Democratic Republic of the Congo |  Djibouti |  Eritrea |  Gambia |  Guinea |  Haiti |  Liberia |  Malawi |  Maldives |  Mali |  Mauritania |  Niger |  Rwanda |  Sierra Leone |  Sudan |  Tuvalu |  Vanuatu and Zambia). Five PIFs had been submitted but not yet cleared by the CEO (from Burundi |  Cambodia |  |  | 1 2 3 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/6 |  annex I. FCCC/SBI/2008/19 |  paragraph 60. FCCC/SBI/2008/8 |  paragraph 47. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2009/6 Page 4 Comoros |  Lesotho and Mauritania). Three PIFs (from Yemen) are expected to be processed once the country’s NAPA has been finalized and submitted. 8. Of the countries that are eligible for funding (i.e. those that have submitted NAPAs) |  11 had yet to submit their first PIF (Central African Republic |  Ethiopia |  Guinea-Bissau |  Kiribati |  Madagascar |  Mozambique |  Sao Tome and Principe |  Senegal |  Solomon Islands |  Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania). 9. In terms of the distribution of funds committed under the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) for the 30 PIFs logged as of 3 March 2009 |  the GEF reported that 70 per cent of those funds are being used to support projects in Africa |  13 per cent in Asia and 17 per cent in the Pacific and the Caribbean. By sector |  37 per cent of the funding is for projects in agriculture and food security |  13 per cent in water management |  23 per cent in vulnerability and risk management and 27 per cent in coastal management. 10. To date |  the following five GEF agencies are supporting the implementation of PIFs: UNDP (supporting the implementation of 19 PIFs) |  UNEP (6) |  the International Fund for Agricultural Development (2) |  the African Development Bank (AfDB) (1) |  the World Bank (1) and AfDB and UNDP jointly (1). C. Consideration of efforts to facilitate implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 1. Additional guidance for the design and preparation of strategies to implement national adaptation programmes of action 11. As part of its work programme |  the LEG is developing a technical paper to offer additional guidance to LDCs on NAPA preparation and design of implementation strategies. This technical paper will present NAPA teams with guidance on the preparation of an implementation strategy as well as a set of key criteria and areas of importance for the reassessment by LDCs of their adaptation needs over time. The paper will also assist NAPA teams in updating and submitting any new priorities on adaptation and vulnerabilities to climate change impacts. 2. Development of a step-by-step guide to implementing national adaptation programmes of action 12. To address the need of LDC Parties for more support and information when accessing funds from the LDCF and implementing NAPAs |  the LEG |  at its fourteenth meeting |  agreed on terms of reference for the preparation of a step-by-step guide to NAPA implementation. The LEG |  at its fifteenth meeting |  discussed |  jointly with the GEF and its agencies |  an extended outline for this guide and agreed on a timeline for the completion and distribution of the English language version by the thirtieth session of the SBI. It was agreed that |  subject to the availability of funding |  the guide will also be made available in French and Portuguese. 3. Training on implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 13. As many LDCs are already in the process of implementing their NAPAs |  the LEG discussed the need to develop a comprehensive training plan aimed at strengthening the capacity of LDC experts to design and implement NAPA projects effectively. The dissemination of the step-by-step guide to experts working on NAPA projects in specific sectors was also discussed. The LEG will identify experts and organizations that will be involved in conducting the training on NAPA implementation. 14. The LDC experts identified a need for targeted training activities that would be of use to those directly involved in the preparation and implementation of NAPAs. These individuals will remain the main recipients of the training |  but it was agreed that the scope could be broadened |  depending on the status of NAPA implementation in countries |  to include those responsible for the implementation of |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2009/6 Page 5 specific NAPA projects in diverse sectors such as agriculture |  water resources |  coastal management |  health and forestry. This would ensure more effective and timely preparation of project proposals and improved follow-up and implementation. The target groups for the training plan referred to in paragraph 13 above would include: (a) (b) (c) National planning officers responsible for climate change projects; NAPA project coordinators; Experts involved in the development and implementation of sector-specific NAPA projects. |  |  |  | 15. In addition to the target groups referred to in paragraph 14 above |  programme officers from the GEF agencies which are directly responsible for national project implementation would also be welcome to participate in the training. 16. The step-by-step guide to NAPA implementation will be widely distributed and sent out to all NAPA project coordinators. The guide will be available in paper copy |  on CD-ROM and on the Least Developed Countries Portal on the UNFCCC website.4 It is envisaged that the step-by-step guide will be translated into French and Portuguese. 17. The LEG agreed on a schedule for three regional workshops: one to be held in October 2009 for anglophone LDCs |  and one for francophone LDCs and another for lusophone LDCs to take place in early 2010 or sooner |  if possible. The LEG emphasized that the implementation of these activities is subject to the availability of funding. 4. Outreach on national adaptation programmes of action 18. The LEG |  at its fourteenth meeting |  discussed the importance of providing updated and extensive information for LDC Parties to facilitate NAPA preparation and implementation. It was decided that an updated website on LDC matters and an LDC portal would be launched on the UNFCCC website. At the fifteenth meeting of the LEG |  recommendations were made regarding specific enhancements to be made to the Least Developed Countries Portal and the key information on NAPAs that should be provided |  including: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Detailed information on NAPA projects; A summary of all reports and other outputs of the LEG since its inception; A list of the members of the LEG; Updates on the LDC work programme; Links to activities of other agencies that have synergy with NAPA projects. D. Interaction between the Least Developed Countries Expert Group and Benin’s national adaptation programme of action team 19. In keeping with its practice of interacting with the national NAPA teams where the LEG meeting is hosted |  the LEG conducted an interactive session with representatives of Benin’s NAPA team. Benin’s NAPA team presented an overview of the NAPA process |  its institutional arrangements and stakeholder consultations |  and plans for implementation. The presentation also discussed the team’s efforts to coordinate the adaptation-related activities of other Rio Conventions in Benin |  by involving the focal points of these conventions in the NAPA coordination committee and by choosing project sites that also address issues of importance to the other conventions. The NAPA team attributed the success of the |  | 4 |  |  |  | <www.unfccc.int/ldc>. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2009/6 Page 6 NAPA process in Benin to the use of participatory and multidisciplinary methods as well as to its flexible approach to achieving the planned results. Benin’s NAPA focuses on the following sectors: agriculture |  forestry |  energy |  coastal areas |  water resources and health. The first NAPA project under implementation will strengthen the capacity of agricultural communities to adapt to climate change in four vulnerable agro-ecological zones of Benin and will be executed by the Ministry of Agriculture. |  |  |  | III. Progress on priority activities for implementation |  | 20. In response to a request by the SBI at its twenty-ninth session | 5 the LEG considered which activities in its work programme for 2008–2010 should take priority. A list of priority activities was presented in document FCCC/SBI/2008/14 |  annex I.

The LEG extended the invitation to experts from the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) secretariat and the World Resources Institute (WRI). 7. The meeting was opened by the Director of Environment in the Ministry of Environment and Forestry Resources of the Government of Togo |  Mr. Essobiyou Thiyu Kohoga. He commended the LEG for its remarkable support to the LDCs for the preparation of NAPAs and voiced the pleasure of the Government of Togo in hosting the 23rd meeting of the LEG. He also communicated Togo’s readiness to embark on the NAP process. 8. During the meeting |  the LEG focused its work on the following: technical guidelines for the NAP process; support needs for the NAP process; a progress report on support given to the NAP process; the LEG NAP event to be held in conjunction with the thirty-eighth sessions of the subsidiary bodies; information systems in support of NAPAs and the NAP process; regional training workshops on adaptation for the LDCs for 2012–2013; training approaches of the LEG; monitoring and evaluation of NAPAs; the LDC work programme and the NAP process; design of in-depth case studies; and linkages with other bodies under the Convention. The LEG also held discussions with the GEF and its agencies and other organizations on support given to the LDCs |  and with the Government of Togo on NAPAs and the NAP process. |  |  |  | B. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Status of preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action |  | Status of preparation of national adaptation programmes of action 9. To date |  49 LDCs have successfully completed their NAPAs. 6 Equatorial Guinea received funding in November 2012 and is in the early stages of NAPA preparation. 10. At least three LDCs |  including Bangladesh |  Bhutan and Senegal |  have revised or updated their NAPAs. The LEG took note that the LDCs continue to rely on technical guidance and advice from the LEG for revising and updating their NAPAs |  and that the expert group stands ready to continue to provide support upon request. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Status of implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 11. The GEF reported that |  as of 3 April 2013 |  45 LDCs had submitted one or more NAPA implementation project proposals to the GEF in the form of a project identification form. Thirty-two countries had submitted at least two projects and 10 had submitted three or more projects. 12. The GEF indicated that |  in total |  95 projects7 (comprising six medium-sized projects and 89 full-sized projects) had been approved by the GEF Council |  with LDCF grants amounting to USD 450.87 million. Of the projects approved |  45 had been endorsed by the Chief Executive Officer of the GEF and are under various stages of implementation. 13. The GEF further reported that |  as at 3 April 2013 |  cumulative donor pledges to the LDCF have amounted to USD 605.3 million |  and that the new ceiling for each LDC for implementing NAPA projects had been set at USD 20 million |  based on the principle of equitable access. |  | 6 7 |  |  |  | This also includes Cape Verde and Maldives |  which graduated out of the LDC category in December 2007 and January 2011 |  respectively. Includes one following a programmatic approach |  the Sahel and West Africa programme in support of the Great Green Wall initiative |  with four projects in Chad |  Ethiopia |  Mali and Togo. |  |  |  | 4 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  |  |  | C. |  |  |  | Technical guidelines for the national adaptation plan process |  | 14. The COP requested the LEG to prepare technical guidelines for the NAP process based on the initial guidelines adopted under decision 5/CP.17. The technical guidelines produced by the LEG are available online in English at <unfccc.int/NAP>. Hard copies are being disseminated to LDC focal points and at various events. 15. The LEG is preparing an interactive online version of the technical guidelines. The online version will be part of a broader information system on NAPs (see chapter II.G below). 16. The LEG is planning to develop materials supplementary to the guidelines |  in order to offer in-depth coverage of selected steps |  in collaboration with relevant organizations and adaptation experts. Those materials will offer step-by-step guides to the building blocks of the NAP process and will include technical papers and technical guidelines for the NAPs |  at national |  sectoral and other levels |  in accordance with the modalities to support NAPs in paragraph 12 of decision 5/CP.17. |  |  |  | D. |  |  |  | Support needs for the national adaptation plan process |  | 17. The LEG reviewed the support needs for the NAP process as listed in the report on the 22nd meeting of the LEG.8 It identified those needs that it would be able to support in accordance with its mandate and expertise and proposed activities that it could undertake in providing such support. A list of the proposed activities for the selected support needs is given in annex I. The LEG noted that the support needs and the proposed activities would need to be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis as the LDCs progress with their NAP processes. 18. In an effort to prioritize the efforts to address the needs |  the LEG conducted a rapid survey of the LDCs on their ideas on possible priority support needs given in the list contained in the report on the 22nd meeting of the LEG. The LEG prioritized the support needs |  taking into account the results of the survey |  to identify those that need to be addressed over the next three years for a successful start of the NAP process in the LDCs: (a) Technical and information papers as supplements to the technical guidelines for the NAP process |  including on: (i) Methods and tools for assessing gaps and needs in adaptation capacity; (ii) Approaches |  processes and options for data analysis |  management and visualization in support of the NAP process; (iii) A guide to developing national adaptation investment plans |  adaptation programmes and capacity-building in absorbing adaptation funding; (iv) Design and implementation of monitoring and evaluation systems for adaptation at multiple levels; (b) Compilation and analysis of information to be shared through information papers covering the following: (i) Analysis of capacity needs and gaps and possible strategies to address them; (ii) Best available knowledge on impacts |  vulnerabilities and adaptation options for knowledge-based/expert systems; |  |  |  | 8 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  paragraph 19. 5 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  |  |  | (iii) Shortlists of recommended data |  methods and tools for risk |  vulnerability and adaptation assessment; (iv) Successes and failures as well as sustainability issues associated with common adaptation options; (v) Experiences |  best practices and lessons learned in the various stages of the NAP process |  including at the regional level; (c) Sharing and exchange of information through NAP Central9 and related information systems on: (i) Available financial and technical support for the NAP process; (ii) Capacity needs and gaps with a view to identifying and mobilizing technical and other support; (iii) Links to available data and information for use in adaptation assessment and planning; (iv) Outreach on NAP information and processes to multiple stakeholders; (v) Compilation of information to support monitoring |  review and evaluation of progress |  effectiveness and gaps on NAPs; (vi) Identification |  analysis and management of key data to support adaptation planning and implementation |  including rescue and archival of legacy data; (d) Training workshops at the regional level to cover the following topics: (i) Identification of gaps and capacity needs in the design and implementation of adaptation actions; (ii) Experiences and approaches for selecting and using assessment tools and models for data analysis and use in decision support |  as well as in communicating the results to decision makers; (iii) Use of appropriate geospatial data management and analysis tools in managing data and information over space and time |  to underpin assessments as part of adaptation planning and the iterative and ongoing nature of such assessments as part of the NAP process; (iv) Analysis of climate data and the development and application of climate change scenarios in assessing climate change risks at the national |  sectoral and local levels; (v) Communicating information and uncertainty to decision makers and policymakers; (vi) Design of research and systematic observations to support adaptation analysis and planning; (vii) Appraisal of adaptation options (economic |  environmental |  etc.) and ranking; (viii) Development of strategies |  projects and programmes to support the formulation and implementation of NAPs; (ix) (x) (e) |  | 9 |  |  |  | Accreditation of national institutions for direct access to funding; Monitoring and evaluation of adaptation; Other training activities: |  |  |  | See paragraph 26 below. |  |  |  | 6 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  |  |  | (i) (ii) |  |  |  | Online courses on steps of the NAP process; Collaboration with formal education programmes. |  |  |  | E. |  |  |  | Progress report on support to the national adaptation plan process |  | 19. The LEG discussed the progress report on support to the NAP process based on its work and the work of the Adaptation Committee |  United Nations organizations |  specialized agencies |  bilateral and multilateral organizations |  and other relevant organizations. As part of the background to the discussion |  the LEG conducted a preliminary survey of the LDCs during the thirty-seventh sessions of the subsidiary bodies and through an e-mail survey in order to capture information on the NAP process |  including on support needs and support received. Furthermore |  some organizations informed the LEG of their efforts in supporting the NAP process. Below is a summary of the support to the NAP process captured by the LEG at its 23rd meeting: (a) Based on the information received from the LDCs through surveys |  most countries indicated that they are actively thinking about the NAP process and are awaiting financial support in order to embark along the steps outlined in the guidelines for the NAPs; (b) The United States of America |  through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) |  supported Jamaica on a national climate change policy framework process. In a joint submission by Jamaica and the United States | 10 the Government of Jamaica partnered with USAID to organize a stakeholder workshop that was aimed at initiating a policy framework process that would begin a process of building support and understanding across different sectors of the economy |  so that the government and private actors responsible for those sectors could understand the effects of climate change on Jamaica’s economy. Following the workshop |  Jamaica is drafting a comprehensive climate change policy framework; (c) With respect to support by the LEG: (i) The LEG developed technical guidelines for the NAP process |  which are available online in English at <unfccc.int/NAP>. Versions in French and Portuguese are being produced and will be posted as soon as they are ready; (ii) The LEG has produced an outreach document summarizing the NAP process in order to facilitate the outreach efforts of climate change focal points in their countries. The document is available in English |  with French and Portuguese versions being made online shortly at <unfccc.int/NAP>; (iii) The LEG conducted two regional training workshops on adaptation for the Pacific and francophone LDCs |  in September 2012 and March 2013 |  respectively. Those training workshops included specific modules on the NAP process |  in order to build the awareness and capacity of the LDCs to initiate the NAP process at their national levels. Eighty participants were trained; (iv) The LEG is designing and implementing an online information system to support the NAP process |  and a prototype is expected to be launched in the middle of 2013 (see chapter II.G below); (d) With respect to the Adaptation Committee |  the three-year workplan of the Committee contains specific activities on the work on modalities and guidelines for NAPs for non-LDC developing countries.11 To that end |  the committee has established an ad hoc |  | 10 11 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/MISC.2. FCCC/SB/2012/3 |  annex II. 7 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  |  |  | group to work on those modalities and guidelines |  and the LEG is participating in that group; (e) Regarding United Nations organizations and specialized agencies: (i) UNDP and UNEP have submitted a proposal to the GEF/LDCF for a support programme for NAPs in the LDCs. The support programme has three pillars: institutional support |  technical support and knowledge brokering. The agencies reported to the LEG at its 23rd meeting that a project proposal on this project had been submitted to the GEF secretariat on 28 February 2013 for funding under the LDCF |  and is awaiting approval by the GEF; (ii) The World Health Organization indicated in its submission on the guidelines for the formulation of NAPs12 that it has reviewed the LEG technical guidelines for the NAP process and adapted them to the needs of the health adaptation process at the national level. 20. In concluding the discussions on the topic |  the LEG noted there are efforts under way to support NAP processes in the LDCs that are not reflected in paragraph 19 above |  and that it would be useful to have more information on the wide range of organizations and their efforts in supporting the NAP process. Such information could be shared with the LEG in addition to information reported in the submissions of Parties to the COP and from the LDCs through the ongoing surveys. |  |  |  | F. |  |  |  | Least developed countries national adaptation plan event |  | 21. Following on from the request from the SBI at its thirty-seventh session | 13 the LEG discussed the planning for the LDC NAP event to be held in conjunction with SBI 38. The LEG Chair highlighted the preliminary meeting conducted with Parties and relevant organizations in Doha in December 2012 |  following the adoption of the request. The ideas collected at that meeting were used in developing a concept note on the event. 22. The event |  to be called NAP Expo: Launching the NAP Process in LDCs |  aims to: (a) (b) process; Provide information on the NAP process to the LDCs and other stakeholders; Provide a platform for sharing tools and methods relevant to the NAP |  |  |  | (c) Offer a forum for relevant organizations and other stakeholders to share information about the support they can provide to the LDCs for the NAP process; (d) Provide a platform for sharing experiences |  best practices and lessons learned |  and showcase relevant case studies. 23. The event will be structured around the elements of the NAP process. It will include presentations from the LEG on the technical aspects of the formulation of NAPs |  presentations from LDC Parties on their plans and needs towards the launching of the NAP process in their countries |  and presentations from agencies and organizations on how they intend to support the NAP process in LDCs. The LEG indicated the importance of having the Chair of the SBI opening the event. 24. The event will bring together the LDCs and other Parties |  the GEF and its agencies |  adaptation practitioners |  relevant organizations |  development agencies |  regional centres and networks |  and individual experts. The LEG is exploring ways to also interact with LDC |  | 12 13 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/MISC.2. FCCC/SBI/2012/33 |  paragraph 69. |  |  |  | 8 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  |  |  | experts who may not be able to attend the event. The LEG emphasized the importance of placing a focus on inviting agencies and organizations that are in a position to offer support to the LDCs on the NAP process. 25. The LEG also agreed that the event should be a continuation of support to the LDCs |  as part of the technical guidance and support to the NAP process |  and should possibly be conducted every year |  at the first session of the year of the subsidiary bodies. |  |  |  | G. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Information systems in support of national adaptation programmes of action and national adaptation plans |  | National adaptation plan information system 26. The LEG continued its work on the design of an information system (to be called NAP Central) |  which will serve as the main information platform for supporting the NAP process. The system will provide information to support the NAP process and to show progress made by countries on their national processes and will include a repository of relevant NAP documents for supporting the LDCs |  with links to relevant data |  information and tools for the NAP process |  to be populated with inputs from countries as well as from relevant organizations |  regional centres and networks |  and the research community. It will also provide information to support COP considerations on NAPs. 27. On the functionalities of the system |  the LEG considered examples of the functions of other information systems on adaptation with a view to using them to inform the design of the NAP information system. The LEG agreed that the functions of the system will include the following: (a) Flexible interfaces to the information to suit the main user groups: technical experts at the country level and organizations that are directly involved in NAP activities; decision makers and policymakers |  including those supporting the climate change negotiations; and broader stakeholders of the NAP process |  including the general public; (b) The use of selected examples and case studies for illustrative purposes to promote the sharing of lessons |  avoiding very comprehensive listings; (c) Flexibility in the storage and display of the information to allow easy updates and the inclusion of new information |  such as through an underlying database management system to manage dynamic content; (d) Design considerations that facilitate access to the best available data and information by countries |  with due consideration given to the technical constraints of the LDCs to access and process some types of data; (e) Where possible |  promotion of access to data and information by country |  to avoid the complexities of extracting country data and information from regional and global data collections; (f) Value added to available information systems. 28. The LEG decided to set up an advisory group composed of adaptation experts and practitioners to serve in an advisory capacity on the design and contents of NAP Central. 29. The LEG will share progress on the development of the information system during the NAP event at the thirty-eighth sessions of the subsidiary bodies. |  |  |  | 9 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Least developed countries portal 30. The LEG also discussed the continuing enhancement of the LDC portal. It noted that information on the implementation of NAPA projects on the portal will need to be enhanced |  to include success stories from completed NAPA projects and to serve as a repository for information that could be used to assess progress |  effectiveness and the identification of gaps in the implementation of NAPAs |  and as a platform for sharing experience |  best practices and lessons learned under NAPAs. 31. Furthermore |  the LEG noted that the best practices and lessons learned platform will be updated to include information from the second volume of the best practices and lessons learned publication and information already collected (through interviews/surveys) from those LDCs that have not yet been featured in those publications. 32. The LEG further noted the additional work that still needs to be done on the portal |  including the development of an online collaboration platform for the LEG |  the LDCs and relevant organizations |  agencies and regional centres |  a LEG platform and an LDC monitor |  and that those functions will be harmonized with similar functions under the abovementioned NAP information system. |  |  |  | H. |  |  |  | Regional training workshops for 2012–2013 |  | 33. The LEG worked on the arrangements for the regional training workshop on adaptation for the francophone LDCs |  which took place from 18 to 22 March in Lomé |  Togo. Based on the technical guidelines for the NAP process |  as well as on the latest decision on NAPs |  the LEG considered further enhancement of the training materials with more comprehensive content on the NAP process than in the first workshop for the Pacific LDCs |  in 2012. 34. The LEG collaborated with various organizations |  agencies |  regional centres and experts in the workshop. The GEF and three of its agencies (namely FAO |  UNDP and UNEP) |  the CBD secretariat |  the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit |  the AGRHYMET regional centre of the Permanent Interstate Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel |  the Association des Femmes Peules Autochtones du Tchad |  two former LEG members |  namely Mr. Adérito Santana from Sao Tome and Principe and Mr. Erwin Künzi from Austria |  as well as other individual experts |  played active roles in the workshop. 35. The workshop was attended by three national adaptation experts/practitioners from climate change ministries/agencies and planning and other relevant ministries/agencies. Participants also included additional national focal points for the CBD from 10 countries through support from the CBD secretariat. This was to provide a platform to promote synergies on the implementation of NAPAs and national biodiversity strategies and action plans (NBSAPS).14 36. The LEG further discussed the logistical arrangements for the remaining regional workshops |  one for Asian LDCs and one for Anglophone African LDCs. The LEG agreed to strive to hold the two workshops before the end of the year. As per the SBI request at SBI 37 | 15 the secretariat will prepare a synthesis report on the regional training workshops upon the completion of the last workshop. 37. The LEG discussed the need for a follow-up workshop for the LDCs in the Pacific region to cover the NAP technical guidelines |  since the workshop for that region took place |  | 14 15 |  |  |  | More information on NBSAPs is available at <http://www.cbd.int/nbsap>. FCCC/SBI/2012/33 |  paragraph 66. |  |  |  | 10 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  |  |  | before the NAP technical guidelines were completed. The LEG agreed to continue to explore opportunities for such a workshop and to make further decisions at its next meeting. |  |  |  | I. |  |  |  | Training approaches of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | 38. The LEG conducts training workshops as one of the modalities for building and/or enhancing the technical capacity of LDCs to address adaptation through NAPAs |  the LDC work programme and the NAP process. During its meeting |  the LEG deliberated on further improving its training approaches in order to deliver its support to the LDCs in an efficient and cost-effective manner. 39. The LEG decided that its training approaches would focus on the following: (a) Building the capacity of the LDCs to manage processes and access support under the Convention |  and to deliver on their reporting on their NAPAs and the NAP process; (b) change; (c) (d) (i) (ii) (e) (f) Developing the problem-solving skills of the LDCs for addressing climate Developing skills in knowledge management; Conducting training through: Workshops; Online training and e-courses; Collaboration with formal education programmes; Tailored publications; |  |  |  | (g) Promoting a common understanding among all relevant stakeholders on NAPAs and the NAP process. 40. The LEG highlighted the value of actively engaging UNFCCC national focal points when working with institutions that support adaptation in the LDCs. 41. The LEG decided to explore ways to record and archive materials used in its regional training workshops in order to ensure they are accessible even after the completion of the workshops and to actively explore the creation of e-courses based on the contents of those workshops. |  |  |  | J. |  |  |  | Monitoring and evaluation of national adaptation programmes of action |  the least developed countries work programme and the national adaptation plan process |  | 42. Based on its previous work | 16 the LEG continued its consideration of monitoring and evaluation of NAPAs and the LDC work programme |  which was extended to the NAP process. The LEG noted the existing efforts on monitoring and evaluation of the NAPAs |  including those carried out by the LEG together with the GEF and its agencies and communicated through the LEG reports | 17 and a joint evaluation of the LDCF carried out by |  |  |  | 16 17 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  paragraph 39. Reports on the meetings of the LEG are available at <http://unfccc.int/6099>. 11 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  |  |  | the Danish Government and the GEF Evaluation Office. 18 The LEG decided that its approach would need to consolidate the results of those to the extent possible. 43. As a way to carry the work forward |  the LEG decided on the following specific activities: (a) Developing a detailed tutorial on the monitoring and evaluation systems |  for use by the LDCs in their national systems; (b) Developing a tool for the monitoring and evaluation of progress |  effectiveness and gaps in the formulation and implementation of NAPAs and NAPs |  as well as implementation of the LDC work programme |  at the national and global levels; (c) Applying the progress |  effectiveness and gaps monitoring and evaluation tool at the national level for country NAP processes |  and at the global level in support of the work of the SBI; (d) Developing an approach for capturing best practices and lessons learned in planning and implementing adaptation as an input towards the monitoring and evaluation of efforts under the NAP process. An ad hoc group would be formed to participate in selecting the best practices from the lessons learned |  to include a member of the Adaptation Committee and adaptation experts and practitioners. |  |  |  | K. |  |  |  | Linkages with other bodies under the Convention |  | 44. The LEG recalled its invitation to the Adaptation Committee on support to the NAP process19 and invited the Adaptation Committee: (a) To assist with outreach on the NAP technical guidelines developed by the LEG to other developing countries that are not LDCs; (b) To nominate one of its members to serve in the LEG advisory group for the development of NAP Central (see paras. 26–29 above); (c) To nominate one of its members to be part of the team for reviewing the methodology and selection of best practices and lessons learned in addressing adaptation (see para. 43(d) above); (d) To assist the LEG and the LDCs with relevant methods for estimating the costs and benefits of adaptation as part of assessments in the formulation of NAPs. 45. The LEG also noted that the Adaptation Committee has invited a member of the LEG to participate in the ad hoc group for the consideration of modalities for NAPs for developing country Parties that are not LDCs. The LEG nominated Mr. Thinley Namgyel (Bhutan) to represent the LEG in that group. 46. On collaboration with the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) |  the LEG recalled its requests to the TEC in support of the LDCs.20 The LEG also noted that the TEC has invited the LEG to participate in the 5th meeting of the TEC and in an expert meeting on technology road maps. The LEG nominated its Vice-Chair |  Mr. Batu Uprety (Nepal) |  to represent the LEG in those meetings. 47. The LEG also discussed its engagement with the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (CGE) |  |  | 18 19 20 |  |  |  | Available at <http://www.thegef.org/gef/sites/thegef.org/files/documents/GEF.LDCF_.SCCF_.7.

In response to decision 4/CP.18 |  paragraph 5 |  the LEG made a submission on longterm finance21 as a way to contribute to the work programme’s efforts to analyse the climate-related financing needs of developing countries with a view to identifying options for the mobilization of resources from a wide variety of sources up to and beyond 2020. 49. In response to the request from the SBI at its thirty-seventh session on support needs for the NAP process |  the LEG reviewed the support needs for the NAP process as identified in the report on the 22nd meeting of the LEG | 22 and identified those needs or activities therein that it would be able to support in accordance with its mandate and expertise. Further details are given in chapter II.D above. 50. The SBI |  at its thirty-seventh session |  also requested the LEG | 23 during its meetings |  in collaboration with the GEF and its agencies |  to further explore issues of some LDCs related to accessing funding from the LDCF for the implementation of their NAPAs |  and to include information on ways and means to enhance the implementation of NAPAs in the reports on its meetings for consideration by the SBI. Further details are given in chapter II.M below. 51. The SBI |  at its thirty-seventh session |  also requested the LEG to organize an LDC NAP event in conjunction with SBI 38. Further details are given in chapter II.F above. |  |  |  | M. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Discussion with the Global Environment Facility and its agencies |  | Proceedings 52.

On support to the NAP process |  the GEF reported that it is still considering action on the mandate from the COP at its eighteenth session to provide funding to the LDCs through the LDCF for activities to enable preparation for the NAP process. The GEF mentioned that it is holding consultations to address this mandate and to better understand the NAP process. 55. The GEF concluded its report by highlighting new elements of the GEF adaptation strategy |  which include the need for projects to include synergies with other GEF focal areas |  and to address medium- and long-term adaptation |  and the GEF results-based management system. 56. Secondly |  UNDP indicated that it has supported LDCs through 61 projects to access the LDCF |  four to access the Special Climate Change Fund and six to access the Adaptation Fund. UNDP also noted other programmes/activities through which it offers support to the LDCs. Those included Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Reviews |  24 the UNDP Adaptation Learning Mechanism |  25 the Capacity Building Programme on the Economics of Climate Change Adaptation | 26 the Boots on the Ground Programme and the Africa Adaptation Programme.27 On gaps and emerging issues in developing NAPA projects |  UNDP noted the following issues: (a) Limited efforts and investment to establish cross-sectoral links and planning within line ministries on climate change issues; (b) Limited initiatives to support the adoption of longer-term planning frameworks. 57. UNDP also highlighted some of the successes in the supported LDCF projects |  including joint programming of LDCF projects by UNDP and UNEP in Comoros and Gambia |  and with the World Bank in Timor-Leste |  and that some countries |  such as Bangladesh |  Guinea |  Lesotho and Nepal |  have succeeded in integrating climate change in their national |  subnational and local planning processes and documents. 58. Thirdly |  UNEP made an input on its continued support to the LDCs in accessing funds from the LDCF |  Special Climate Change Fund and Adaptation Fund |  and on the UNEP Ecosystem-based Adaptation Programme and other related initiatives. It noted specific areas of support to NAPA implementation |  including support to undertaking vulnerability |  impacts and adaptation assessments for informed decision-making |  support for building capacity for integrating adaptation into national and local planning |  support for the demonstration of adaptation measures |  and support for up-scaling adaptation at the national and local levels |  including through private-sector engagement. 59. UNEP highlighted the following specific challenges in the design and implementation of LDCF projects: (a) Difficulties in establishing the adaptation rationale |  owing to a lack of climate data and assessments to make the case for the projects |  and distinction between the development baseline and the adaptation baseline and between the co-financing/baseline project concepts (understanding the in-kind and grant/cash contribution); (b) (c) Lack of sufficient evidence on the effectiveness of adaptation measures; Changing procedures in the review process of LDCF projects; |  |  |  | 24 25 26 27 |  |  |  | <http://www.aideffectiveness.org/CPEIR>. <http://www.undp-alm.org>. <http://www.undp-alm.org/projects/cca-economics>. <https://www.undp-aap.org/>. |  |  |  | 14 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  |  |  | (d) Cultural and religious barriers related to the achievement of gender balance in some activities – in some instances women are not associated with project activities |  owing to the hiring process; (e) Co-implementation with other agencies |  which presents an additional layer of complexity (financial management |  results tracking and procedures). 60. Lastly |  FAO highlighted its commitment in supporting the implementation of NAPAs. It highlighted the following challenges in supporting LDCF projects: (a) A concern by agriculture policymakers and stakeholders that the issue of climate change is overtaking other priorities that are equally or even more important; (b) Level of understanding by some agriculture sector stakeholders of the GEF funds and procedures in order for them to fully participate in the design and implementation of LDCF projects. 61. The LEG took note of the absence of inputs from the other GEF agencies that were not represented at this meeting |  and agreed to explore ways and means for the other agencies to share their experiences with the LEG |  such as through a survey. |  |  |  | N. |  |  |  | Interaction with other organizations and experts |  | 62. The CBD secretariat shared information with the LEG on its ongoing efforts in creating synergies between the work of the CBD Convention and the UNFCCC Convention. It highlighted the efforts made in ensuring that biodiversity and biodiversitybased livelihoods are taken into consideration in climate change adaptation and mitigation |  and that decisions on biodiversity are ‘climate smart’. It also provided suggestions on synergies between the NAP process and NBSAPS |  based on the work done in 2011 and 2012. 63. The WRI presented a framework developed for assessing national institutional capacity for climate change adaptation28 and provided examples on how that tool was applied in Bolivia (Plurinational State of) and Nepal |  two of the pilot countries. The LEG proposed that the WRI consider tailoring the framework in order that it can be applied by the LDCs in the NAP process. 64. The LEG agreed to work closely with the two organizations mentioned above |  and other relevant organizations |  in producing supplements to the technical guidelines |  which will provide more in-depth details and case studies on synergies and capacity needs and gap analysis. |  |  |  | O. |  |  |  | Interaction with the Government of Togo on the national adaptation programme of action and the national adaptation plan process |  | 65. In keeping with its practice of interacting with the NAPA team of the host country |  the LEG conducted an interactive session with representatives of the Government of Togo on NAPAs and the NAP process. The Government of Togo presented progress made in implementing the first NAPA project |  which is aimed at addressing adaptation of agriculture production to climate change in Togo. The project is building on the National Programme on Investment in Agriculture and Food Security (2010–2015) |  which has been under way for three years with funding from the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The government also presented a second NAPA project that aims to establish |  | 28 |  |  |  | <http://www.wri.org/project/vulnerability-and-adaptation/nac-framework>. 15 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  |  |  | integrated management of the risk of floods and degraded land. The project has three components: strengthening of existing institutions and awareness-raising; community-based adaptation activities |  including for addressing land degradation; and establishment of early warning systems. The government team concluded by indicating that Togo is ready to embark on the NAP process and is willing to be considered for the in-depth case studies that the LEG is developing. The LEG provided feedback to the government team in order to facilitate effective implementation of the projects. |  |  |  | III. Work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2013–2014 |  | 66. The LEG reviewed the progress made in implementing its work programme for 2012–2013. In addition to the existing activities |  which are either under implementation or will be implemented in 2013 |  the group identified new activities as part of its work programme. The rolling work programme for 2013–2014 is presented in annex II. 67. The LEG further elaborated on complementary approaches for the delivery of the work programme for 2013–2014 |  which include the following: (a) Conducting in-depth case studies in the LDCs to gain a deeper understanding of the LDCs’ experiences with NAPAs |  the LDC work programme and the NAP process |  with a view to informing the LEG on how to best structure and deliver its support to the

Paragraph 5 of the terms of reference of the LEG (annex to decision 29/CP.7) states that the LEG is to elect annually a Chair |  a Vice-Chair and two rapporteurs from among its least developed country (LDC) members. At the first meeting of the LEG (report contained in document FCCC/SBI/2002/5) |  the group agreed on the functions of each of its officers |  and at its seventh meeting it established the post of lusophone Rapporteur (FCCC/SBI/2005/12). At the ninth meeting the group elected the following officers: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Mr. Bubu Pateh Jallow (Gambia) |  Chair Mr. Chanel Iroi (Solomon Islands) |  Vice-Chair Ms. Madeleine Rose Diouf-Sarr (Senegal) |  francophone Rapporteur Mr. Almeida Alberto Sitoe (Mozambique) |  lusophone Rapporteur Mr. Karma L. Rapten (Bhutan) |  anglophone Rapporteur. B. Review of preparation of national adaptation programmes of action 6. In reviewing the status of NAPA preparation |  the LEG took note of the three NAPAs that had been submitted to the secretariat by the end of 2005. Based on the LEG’s interaction with the Global Environmental Facility (GEF) and its implementing agencies |  the information available to the LEG indicated that a large number of NAPAs were at an advanced stage of preparation as a result of ongoing efforts and many of them are expected to be submitted during 2006–2007. 7. The LEG noted the efforts made by the implementing agencies in providing support to LDC Parties and NAPA teams for the development of project proposals |  for capacity-building and for the provision of technical advice. The LEG also reviewed its responsiveness to requests from NAPA teams |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2006/9 Page 4 for technical comments on draft NAPAs and noted that its recommendations had been translated by NAPA teams into improvements in the NAPAs submitted. C. Consideration of implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 8. In decision 4/CP.11 |  the COP requested the LEG |  serving in an advisory capacity to the least developed countries |  to develop a work programme that includes implementation of NAPAs. The LEG |  at its ninth meeting |  in considering its work programme |  benefited from the participation of many of its members in the GEF consultation on the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) held in Dhaka |  that preceded the ninth meeting of the LEG. 9. The LEG in reviewing its mandate |  in particular paragraph 9 (a)–(e) of the Annex to decision 29/CP.7 |  identified activities and related actions in support of NAPA implementation and detailed them in its work programme for 2006–2007 (see annex I). Members assumed responsibility for further detailing the work programme in order to track its progress over the biennium. D. Efforts to advise on capacity-building needs and to facilitate the exchange of information 1. LEG members’ participation in the GEF–LDCF consultation meeting 10. The ninth meeting of the LEG was held back-to-back with a consultation organized by the GEF on the LDCF and efforts of the GEF to operationalize this fund. Several members of the LEG participated in this meeting. The GEF programming paper for the LDCF was introduced and considered. 11. Representatives of the GEF and its implementing and executing agencies were invited to the LEG meeting to provide an update on their NAPA activities |  as detailed below. 2. LEG interaction with the GEF and implementing agencies on NAPA preparation 12. The GEF and its implementing agencies |  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |  the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Bank |  provided the LEG with an update on their efforts to support NAPA preparation through capacity-building |  technical feedback and outreach efforts with NAPA teams in workshops |  training activities and visits to countries. The scope of efforts by UNDP |  UNEP |  the World Bank and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (executing agency of NAPA related projects) was detailed to the LEG members as were constraints in the provision of support and technical advice. The implementing agencies reported that a high level of confidence was evident in NAPA teams; despite this |  however |  technical and institutional constraints continue to hamper the NAPA preparation process. 13. The GEF and its implementing agencies noted that the LEG supported their efforts by playing an active role in advising LDC Parties in the NAPA preparation phase. 14. The LEG concluded that continued and closer collaboration is needed in order to support those LDC Parties that have yet to prepare NAPA proposals for funding |  and to support NAPA teams that are in various stages of NAPA preparation. The LEG identified the need to continue monitoring bottlenecks and constraints in the preparation of NAPAs through targeted questionnaires. The group also recognized the need to provide technical advice to LDC Parties in the preparation of project proposals to support NAPA implementation. 3. LEG interaction with Bangladesh’s NAPA team 15. In conjunction with its ninth meeting |  and in keeping with its practice of interacting with NAPA teams of the host country |  the LEG conducted an interactive session with representatives of the Bangladesh NAPA team. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2006/9 Page 5 16. The Bangladesh NAPA team noted that it had already submitted its NAPA1 to the secretariat. The team presented the LEG with its main findings and reported on the prioritization of activities and identification of urgent and immediate projects for implementation. It detailed the extensive national consultations that had been held |  as well as the scope of involvement of national experts and their related agencies in the preparation of the NAPA. 17. The Bangladesh NAPA team explained that results of various stakeholder consultations on the NAPA activities and related projects will address |  among other concerns |  the impacts of climate change on the lives and livelihoods of communities |  poverty reduction and sustainable income generation |  as well as enhancing adaptive capacity at the community and national levels. It was also pointed out that some projects included in the Bangladesh NAPA represent ongoing pilot research projects that are expected to be implemented. The team also highlighted that the next step in the the NAPA process would include meetings to seek support for the development of project documents and co-financing through bilateral and multilateral sources |  which could complement resources from the LDCF in the implementation of NAPAs. |  |  |  | III. Elaboration of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2006–2007 |  | 18. As requested by the COP in decision 4/CP.11 |  the LEG developed |  at its ninth meeting |  a work programme for 2006–2007 that includes elements for implementation of NAPAs (see annex I). 19. In preparing its work programme |  the LEG |  in considering decision 4/CP.11 |  noted that its ongoing efforts to fulfil its mandate |  as detailed in decision 29/CP.7 (annex |  paragraph 9 (a)–(e)) |  continue to be relevant and will serve as the principal means of supporting NAPA implementation. 20. The LEG considered it essential to keep under review |  based on NAPAs submitted |  as well as drafts of NAPAs referred to it for comments |  the activities detailed in its mandate. It considered that there is a continuing need for it to provide technical guidance and advice on the preparation of NAPAs |  to advise on capacity-building |  to facilitate the exchange of information |  and to advise on efforts to mainstream adaptation into development planning. It also recognized that LDC Parties would require advice on NAPA implementation. 21. The LEG also considered that closer collaboration with the implementing agencies will continue to be important in the NAPA preparation and implementation phases |  because technical and institutional constraints for NAPA preparation and implementation continue to arise. |  |  |  | 1 |  |  |  | <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/nap/bannap01.pdf>. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2006/9 Page 6 Annex I |  |  |  | Work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2006–2007 |  | Mandate Annex to decision 29/CP.7 Paragraph 9 (a).

The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by its decision 29/CP.7 |  established the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) to advise on the preparation and implementation strategy for national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) |  and adopted the terms of reference of the LEG. According to these terms of reference |  the LEG is to convene twice each year |  and report on its work to the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI). 2. In response to the request of the COP at its thirteenth session | 1 the LEG developed |  at its thirteenth meeting |  a work programme for 2008–2010 | 2 which was considered by the SBI at its twenty-eighth session. The SBI |  at its thirtieth session |  requested the LEG to keep it informed of the efforts of the LEG in implementing its work programme over the period 2008–2010.3 The LEG further developed |  at its sixteenth meeting |  a list of priority activities for 2010 | 4 which were considered by the SBI at its thirty-first session. |  |  |  | II. |  |  |  | Summary of the eighteenth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | Proceedings |  | 3. The eighteenth meeting of the LEG was held in Kathmandu |  Nepal |  from 12 to 15 October 2010. 4. The COP |  by its decision 8/CP.13 |  decided that the LEG may invite |  when deemed necessary |  the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its agencies to its meetings. To this end |  representatives of the GEF and three of its agencies – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) |  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) – participated in the eighteenth meeting of the LEG. In addition |  in accordance with the conclusions of the SBI at its twenty-ninth session5 encouraging the LEG to engage a wide range of organizations to support the implementation of its work programme and the least developed countries (LDC) work programme | 6 the LEG extended the invitation to the secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to participate in the meeting. 5. The Minister of Environment and Natural Resources of Nepal |  Mr. Thakur Prasad Sharma |  opened the meeting. He highlighted the importance of the NAPA in advancing adaptation planning for Nepal and the need for effective implementation to begin immediately upon completion of the preparation phase. A representative of the secretariat gave an overview of NAPAs |  emphasizing their usefulness as mechanisms through which LDCs can communicate their urgent and immediate vulnerabilities to climate change; and whose preparation and implementation has resulted in national capacity being built for adaptation to climate change. The representative underscored the important role of NAPAs as a first step in national adaptation efforts in LDCs. The Chair of the LEG |  Mr. Fred Machulu Onduri |  highlighted the main achievements of the LEG in supporting LDCs since |  | 1 2 3 4 5 6 |  |  |  | A. |  |  |  | Decision 8/CP.13.

During the meeting |  the LEG focused its work on reviewing the status of NAPA preparation and implementation |  and progress made in implementing priority activities of the LEG work programme for 2008–2010. In the interaction with the GEF and its agencies |  the LEG reviewed the support being provided to those countries still preparing their NAPAs |  the efforts being made to support implementation of NAPAs and the lessons learned and best practices drawn from the NAPA process. The LEG also had discussions with WHO and the secretariat of UNCCD on how to enhance support to LDCs when updating |  revising and implementing their NAPAs. |  |  |  | B. |  |  |  | Status of preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action |  | 7. As at 11 November 2010 |  of the 48 LDCs that had received funding for the preparation of NAPAs |  45 had submitted NAPAs to the secretariat and three (Angola |  Myanmar and Timor-Leste) had yet to submit completed NAPAs.7 Timor-Leste is at an advanced stage of NAPA preparation and is expected to submit its NAPA to the secretariat by the end of 2010. Equatorial Guinea and Somalia have yet to access funding for preparing their NAPAs. 8. On the status of implementation of NAPAs |  the GEF reported on NAPA projects under its consideration. As at 15 October 2010 |  38 countries had officially submitted one or more NAPA projects to the GEF. Nineteen projects in Bangladesh |  Benin |  Bhutan |  Burkina Faso |  Cambodia |  Cape Verde |  Comoros |  Democratic Republic of the Congo |  Djibouti |  Eritrea |  Liberia |  Maldives |  Mali |  Niger |  Rwanda |  Samoa |  Sudan |  Tuvalu and Zambia had received endorsement by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the GEF |  and at least four projects in Guinea |  Guinea-Bissau |  Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Malawi are expected to have been endorsed by the CEO of the GEF before the end of 2010. In addition to these 19 projects |  the CEO of the GEF and the GEF Council had approved 19 project identification forms (PIFs) |  for projects that are starting to apply for funding |  from Afghanistan |  Burundi |  Cambodia |  Ethiopia |  Gambia |  Haiti |  Kiribati |  Lesotho |  Liberia |  Mali |  Mauritania |  Mozambique |  Samoa |  Sao Tome and Principe |  Senegal |  Sierra Leone |  United Republic of Tanzania |  Vanuatu and Yemen |  and five PIFs from Central African Republic |  Haiti |  Sao Tome and Principe |  Solomon Islands and Togo are pending clearance by the CEO and approval by the GEF Council. 9. To date |  the following GEF agencies are currently supporting the implementation of NAPA projects: UNDP (supporting the implementation of 29 NAPA projects) |  World Bank (four) |  UNEP (11) |  the International Fund for Agricultural Development (two) |  the African Development Bank (three) |  UNDP and UNEP jointly (two) and FAO (three). 10. As at 4 August 2010 |  22 donors had pledged USD 290 million to the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF).8 As at 31 May 2010 |  cumulative net funding allocated |  committed or disbursed by the GEF Council and CEO amounted to USD 135 million.9 The balance of these sums (USD 155 million) indicates the level of available funds in the LDCF. |  | 7 |  |  |  | 8 |  |  |  | 9 |  |  |  | Cape Verde received funds and prepared and submitted a NAPA |  but has since graduated from the LDC group. The current total number of LDC Parties to the Convention is 49. See the report of the GEF to the COP at its sixteenth session contained in document FCCC/CP/2010/5. As footnote 5 above. |  |  |  | 4 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/26 |  |  |  | C. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Consideration of the preparation of national adaptation programmes of action |  | Enhanced support to countries at the preparation stage 11. The LEG discussed the efforts made by the countries that were still preparing NAPAs and took note of their progress since its last meeting. As at 15 October 2010 |  Nepal had finalized its NAPA |  Timor-Leste was at the final stages of NAPA preparation |  and both were expected to submit their NAPAs to the secretariat before the end of 2010. Angola and Myanmar had made progress in the preparation of their NAPAs; the LEG will continue to follow these cases until the end of its mandate. The LEG also resumed its discussion on ways of assisting Equatorial Guinea |  in collaboration with the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention |  in preparing its NAPA alongside its initial national communication. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Updates to guidelines 12. The LEG noted several advances in the design and implementation of NAPA projects |  and identified the need for updating the “Annotated guidelines for the preparation of national adaptation programmes of action” | 10 which include guidelines for the update and revision of NAPAs. Some areas of the guidelines that could be updated are noted in a LEG technical paper Least developed countries national adaptation programmes of action: Overview of preparation |  design of implementation strategies and submission of revised project lists and profiles | 11 and include: (a) The integration of the NAPA planning process into broader national-level planning |  including the consideration of issues such as gender; (b) The need to address new information requirements to satisfy new project development guidelines |  for example by using the PIF instead of the project development fund window that was being applied when some of the earlier NAPAs were prepared; (c) The design of implementation strategies to reflect sector-wide approaches and programmatic approaches |  as opposed to the original designs centred around individual projects; (d) Greater emphasis on identifying baselines |  additional adaptation costs and the monitoring and evaluation of results using project-level indicators as required by the latest GEF/LDCF guidelines; (e) Approaches to scaling up from concentrating on a small number of target areas (geographically and in terms of sectors covered) to considering the whole country and all sectors |  including how to design and sequence implementation so as to facilitate access to additional funding as it becomes available; (f) How to move from addressing urgent and immediate needs to addressing medium- and long-term adaptation needs |  including the ‘climate proofing’ of development and building resilience of communities to the adverse effects of climate change; (g) Methods for making NAPA preparation and the identification of priorities for implementation a continuous process |  with an established NAPA team that could update and revise the NAPA as vulnerabilities and other conditions change. |  |  |  | 10 11 |  |  |  | <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/annguid_e.pdf>. <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/ldc_tp2009.pdf>. 5 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/26 |  |  |  | D. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Consideration of the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action |  | Training workshops 13. The LEG organized training workshops on implementing NAPAs for lusophone LDCs (on 4–8 September 2010 in Sao Tome |  Sao Tome and Principe) and for Pacific LDCs (on 3–6 November 2010 in Apia |  Samoa) in the second half of 2010 |  completing the planned series of five workshops on implementation of NAPAs as part of the LEG work programme for 2008–2010. The LEG discussed the overall design of the workshops and the feedback received from participants. A full report on the workshops is given in a separate report to the SBI.12 Overall |  the LEG and the agencies concluded that the regional workshops had been very useful in improving the awareness of LDC Parties and their NAPA teams of everything to do with the LDCF and NAPA implementation. Participants expressed their appreciation of the workshops |  and several countries have requested assistance in developing training materials for use in implementing adaptation at the national level. 14. The issue of language is very important for non-English speaking LDCs. The abovementioned training workshop for lusophone LDCs was conducted entirely in Portuguese |  and participants welcomed the translation into Portuguese of the publication Step-by-Step Guide for Implementing National Adaptation Programmes of Action.13 and the customization of the training materials. 15. While most LDC Parties would like to implement their NAPAs as programmes |  the need exists for clarification of what a programmatic approach is |  and information on how to successfully implement it under the LDCF. 16. The LDC Parties referred to their urgent need for assistance in developing negotiation skills in English |  to enable them to effectively engage in the climate negotiations that are conducted in English. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Design of implementation 17. The LEG discussed the design of NAPA implementation in detail. This included the establishment of baselines |  additional cost of adaptation (co-financing) and the coordination of implementation with other programmes and projects on adaptation and development. 18. As the amount of funding available to each LDC Party continues to increase |  such Parties will need to carefully design the implementation of their NAPAs and other elements of the LDC work programme in order to circumvent the constraints encountered in the past with regard to project design |  institutional arrangements and relationships with agencies. 19. As more funding opportunities become available for adaptation |  such as through the Adaptation Fund or the Special Climate Change Fund |  or from external programmes such as the UNDP–Japan Africa Adaptation Programme |  the World Bank Pilot Program for Climate Resilience and many bilateral programmes |  LDC NAPA teams will need to design a strategy to manage and coordinate the pursuit of different funding channels. The active involvement of donors in the design of implementation strategies of NAPAs |  such as in the case of Nepal |  was seen as a good practice from which other countries can learn. 20. Project management |  including procurement |  results monitoring and evaluation |  is an important consideration for many LDCs. |  |  |  | 12 13 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/15. <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/ldc_napa2009.pdf>. |  |  |  | 6 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/26 |  |  |  | 21. In preparing NAPAs and developing first NAPA projects |  national NAPA teams build their own capacity through learning-by-doing |  and selected implementing agencies should capitalize on this increasing capacity of national NAPA teams in order to limit the reliance on international consultants to support the implementation of NAPAs. Therefore the LEG continues to recommend that the GEF agencies use local/national experts/consultants during the project design phase. The LEG also discussed the choice of agencies for implementing second and subsequent NAPA projects under the LDCF |  and recommended that LDC Parties incorporate lessons learned during the implementation of the first project and the experiences of other countries. 3. Status of review and update of national adaptation programmes of action 22. On the status of revision and update of NAPAs |  as at 15 October 2010 |  the NAPA of Bangladesh had been officially updated and that of Senegal revised. Nepal |  on the other hand |  has expanded on the NAPA preparation guidelines to include medium- and long-term planning considerations in its NAPA in order to circumvent revisions and updates in the immediate future. 4. Surveys and country case files 23. To enhance support to LDCs in their NAPA implementation strategies |  the LEG conducted surveys of LDC Parties at sessions of the subsidiary bodies and through national focal points in order to collect information on the status of implementation of NAPAs and on any obstacles that Parties may be facing. The LEG initiated these surveys at the twentyeighth session of the SBI. Sixteen countries responded to the survey (Afghanistan |  Benin |  Bhutan |  Haiti |  Lesotho |  Malawi |  Nepal |  Niger |  Rwanda |  Timor-Leste |  Togo |  Tuvalu |  Uganda |  United Republic of Tanzania |  Vanuatu and Zambia). 24. The LEG |  in collaboration with the GEF and its agencies |  has addressed many of the obstacles met by the LDCs |  which mainly concern capacity at the national and agency levels to design projects |  access to funds and exchange of information. In the surveys |  LDCs recognized the important role played by the LEG in providing key support through the NAPA process |  and all of them wanted to see the continuation of this support. 25. In addition |  in 2010 the LEG conducted twelve country case studies (Bhutan |  Burkina Faso |  Cambodia |  Central African Republic |  Haiti |  Kiribati |  Rwanda |  Sierra Leone |  Sudan |  Timor-Leste |  Uganda and Zambia) as an ongoing contribution to the analysis of the experiences gained from the preparation and implementation of NAPAs at the national and global levels. 26. The surveys are part of the inputs of the LEG to the preparation and review of its work programme |  and in particular the NAPA process. They are a means of identifying best practices and lessons learned as well as the remaining obstacles in the NAPA process. The outcomes of this work are contained in the “Synthesis report on the national adaptation programme of action process |  including operation of the Least Developed Countries Fund”.14 These outcomes will also be used in a forthcoming LEG publication on lessons learned and best practices in the preparation and implementation of NAPAs. |  |  |  | E. |  |  |  | Review of implementation of the Least Developed Countries work programme |  | 27. The LEG examined the status of implementation of the elements of the LDC work programme other than the NAPAs |  and observed that no projects have been funded as yet |  | 14 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/17. 7 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/26 |  |  |  | under the LDCF as stipulated by decision 5/CP.14. The LEG also observed that some elements were being addressed by LDC Parties with support from programmes outside the UNFCCC process |  such as programmes for strengthening observational networks through the World Meteorological Organization |  or capacity-building efforts designed to help LDCs to participate in the clean development mechanism. A small number of LDC Parties have made institutional arrangements for addressing climate change and NAPAs in particular; however |  the LEG acknowledged the critical need for strengthening national focal points and national climate change secretariats or committees |  as a useful approach to providing a lasting guide to the design and implementation of climate change programmes. 28. On the question of whether the list of six main areas of the work programme requires updating or revision |  the LEG concluded that some further elements could be added to the current list |  and that a process could be established by the SBI for such an update and revision. Important steps would include a call for submissions from Parties and organizations |  and in the event that the LEG mandate is extended |  the LEG could be asked to critically examine the work programme and propose enhancements to the list and their implementation. |  |  |  | F. |  |  |  | Consideration of experiences |  best practices and lessons learned |  | 29. The LEG discussed a preliminary outline of work to capture and communicate best practices |  lessons learned and key conclusions to be drawn from the preparation and implementation of NAPAs and the LDC work programme. The LEG agreed on an overall approach to presenting the lessons learned in a manner that will facilitate application in future areas |  allow learning from experience and avoid past mistakes. The LEG also agreed on a set of key themes to guide a report on experiences |  lessons learned and best practices |  and |  subsequently |  a publication for wide distribution. Country case studies carried out during the training workshops on the implementation of NAPAs and the surveys conducted by the LEG would provide a basis for formulating information on the key experiences |  lessons and best practices. |  |  |  | G. |  |  |  | Need for revision and updates of national adaptation programmes of action |  | 30. The SBI |  at its thirty-second session |  invited the LEG |  as part of the implementation of its work programme for 2010 | 15 to provide information on the need to revise and update NAPAs |  as well as on the resources that would be required to undertake a revision or update if Parties chose to do so. 31. The LEG discussed the rationale for the revision and update of NAPAs |  taking into account the views of Parties in their submissions16 to the secretariat as well as responses to surveys conducted by the LEG and feedback from regional workshops on implementation of NAPAs. The LEG noted the degree of effort that may be required to revise or update a NAPA |  from minor changes that may be accomplished very easily and submitted through a simple memo to the secretariat to more comprehensive changes that would require updating the whole NAPA document after a series of steps to integrate new information. 32. The LEG identified the following examples of potential reasons that may warrant the revision and update of NAPAs;: |  |  |  | 15 16 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/10 |  paragraph 87. FCCC/SBI/2010/MISC.9. |  |  |  | 8 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/26 |  |  |  | (a) Reformulation of a priority project identified in a NAPA |  such as to indicate a shift in the location for the project or to specify simple changes to the list of priority projects; (b) New risks and vulnerabilities become evident |  especially two years or more after a NAPA was completed; (c) The need to address additional information requirements in order to meet new project programme development guidelines |  such as information required under the current guidelines for project development (using the PIF instead of the PDF window that was in use when some of the earlier NAPAs were prepared); (d) The need to elaborate vulnerabilities and adaptation solutions in a sector that was not covered adequately during the initial NAPA preparation; this could involve integrating NAPA priorities into sector-wide programmes or a national programme on climate change; (e) The need to comprehensively update and re-prioritize the NAPA activities |  such as after a major natural disaster when key vulnerabilities would have changed; (f) The need to scale up adaptation actions from a pilot project involving a few vulnerable communities to adaptation actions that cover all vulnerable sectors and communities in the country |  including through full integration of the NAPA and adaptation activities into national development plans and programmes |  including through the development of national climate change strategies; (g) The need to explore opportunities to integrate lessons learned from the implementation of NAPAs by other LDCs and to incorporate regional synergy. 33. Given the diversity of reasons for updating a NAPA |  resource requirements will vary. The LEG surveyed the costs of preparing different plans and noted the costs for preparation of NAPAs. There is no limit to how much a country can access from the LDCF for the preparation of a NAPA |  but most LDCs applied for USD 200 | 000 from the GEF because the process is faster and easier as compared with applications to the LDCF for amounts greater than this sum. Several countries raised additional funding to supplement their NAPA preparation |  and in the case of Nepal a total of USD 1.3 million was raised. 34. The LEG also discussed the case of Senegal and Bangladesh |  the two LDCs that have officially revised or updated their NAPAs and acknowledged that the minor change made by Senegal to its NAPA did not require the mobilization of significant resources as it was a simple revision of the priority list in the NAPA. On the other hand |  Bangladesh conducted a more comprehensive update of its NAPA |  at a cost of USD 350 | 000. 35. In taking stock of the above and an informal discussion with GEF agencies that are involved in providing support to countries in the preparation of national plans |  the LEG noted the following: (a) There are very few examples of revisions and updates of national plans from which to draw substantial conclusions. Those that do exist show that the financial resources needed for the revision and update of NAPAs differ from case to case. In some instances |  no external resources would be required |  that is |  the revision and update would be supported by the national budget only |  while in other cases |  the revision and update may require the mobilization of significant additional financial support; (b) The extent of required funding varies depending on the degree of update being planned; for a comprehensive plan with consultations |  sectoral assessments and the involvement of all stakeholders |  the indicated amount is in the range of USD 0.5 to 1 million |  as shown in the case of Nepal and in information from agencies such as UNDP; |  |  |  | 9 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/26 |  |  |  | (c) It is likely that most LDC Parties embarking on an update to their NAPAs will develop a more programmatic approach to packaging their urgent and immediate adaptation priorities |  taking into account the latest national development plans |  either at the national level or at the sector-wide level. 36. The LEG also noted that arrangements for updating NAPAs could include the development of a national climate change unit (or other appropriate name) |  which would oversee the preparation and implementation of NAPAs |  and adaptation generally |  on a continuous basis rather than as a one-off project that would end after a few months. This would address the main concerns raised by many Parties about the lack of funding to sustain NAPA teams beyond the GEF project for NAPA preparation. |  |  |  | H. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Discussions with the Global Environment Facility and its agencies |  | Proceedings 37. The LEG allocated the first two days of its meeting to hold discussions with the GEF and its agencies. The GEF secretariat |  FAO |  UNDP and UNEP participated in the discussions |  which focused on the following: updates on the progress made in NAPA preparation and implementation; feedback from the regional training workshop for lusophone LDCs referred to in paragraph 13 above; the sharing of experiences of the implementation of NAPAs and the LDC work programme; the identification of support needs for implementation; best practices and lessons learned from the NAPA process; the views of different agencies on NAPAs; the review of the Brussels Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001–2010 under the United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries |  Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States; and future collaboration with the GEF and its agencies and other adaptation programmes. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Main issues raised 38. The LEG welcomed the contribution made by the GEF and its agencies towards implementation of the LEG work programme for 2008–2010 |  in particular in supporting the regional workshops on the implementation of NAPAs. The LEG also expressed its appreciation of the efforts made by the GEF and its agencies in improving their communication with LDCs in addressing issues that arise during the preparation and implementation of NAPAs. 39. In response to growing concern among LDCs about co-financing for LDCF projects |  the representative of the GEF announced that the GEF is preparing an information note to explain the concept and clarify its application. The representative explained that cofinancing under the LDCF as defined in decision 3/CP.11 is not identical to co-financing requirements under GEF Trust Fund projects. The representative further indicated that under the LDCF |  LDC Parties are expected to report only on the existing investments in the sectors relevant to the project being proposed |  and that no new financing is required to match the contribution from the GEF. The agencies present at the meeting commented that after a country team has completed one application under the LDCF |  the concept of cofinancing and its application becomes easier. The GEF representative was reminded about a request by LDC Parties for the GEF CEO to send a letter to agencies to clarify the correct application of co-financing for LDCF projects. 40. The GEF representative mentioned that there are several products and publications at the final stages of preparation for the GEF LDCF Council |  including: (a) A paper on results-based management for LDCF and Special Climate Change Fund projects; |  |  |  | 10 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/26 |  |  |  | (b) A paper clarifying access to the LDCF |  which includes a simplified explanation of co-financing and additional costs for adaptation; (c) New PIF/PPG templates for LDCF projects; |  |  |  | (d) A template for programme proposals under the GEF |  which could also be used under the LDCF. 41. During the meeting |  it was acknowledged that operations to assist LDC Parties to develop projects and to access the LDCF are becoming routine. It was noted |  however |  that the new PIF/PPG templates that are about to be released by the GEF might lead to delays and confusion |  similar to what was experienced during the last change from the PDF to the PIF. The GEF representative assured the LEG that every effort will be made to avoid any delays in projects that are already in the pipeline. 42. It was noted that since an increasing number of LDCs are moving towards implementation on the ground of their first NAPA project |  additional support would need to be provided to them in the near future |  in particular on issues of project management such as procurement procedures |  financial management and tools for national-level monitoring and evaluation. 43. All agencies present reaffirmed the value of interacting with the LEG during its meetings. The representatives of UNDP and UNEP explained how these interactions have been instrumental in identifying and addressing many of the difficulties faced by LDCs during the preparation and implementation of their NAPAs. The representative of UNDP added that the participation of UNDP in the LEG meetings has helped to realign UNDP operations in support of LDCs in the context of NAPAs. The representative of FAO mentioned that the participation of FAO in LEG meetings was very useful for developing thinking on climate change adaptation. All stakeholders supported the view that these interactions should continue if the mandate of the LEG was renewed. |  |  |  | I. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Interaction with other organizations |  | Proceedings 44. During 2009 to 2010 |  the LEG gradually increased its collaboration with UNCCD to look at ways of integrating UNCCD national action programmes (NAPs) with NAPAs. In parallel |  collaboration with WHO was initiated in recognition of the synergies that could be explored to facilitate implementation of the Libreville Declaration on Health and Environment in Africa | 17 in which African countries agree to establish a strategic alliance between the health and environment sectors. In addition |  WHO conducted an analysis of health considerations in NAPAs and has formally submitted it to the secretariat. 45. During the second day of the meeting |  the LEG invited UNCCD and WHO to share with the expert group |  the GEF and its agencies their views on the NAPA process and to discuss the above-mentioned areas of collaboration. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Main issues raised 46. The UNCCD representative explained that synergies between NAPs and NAPAs could be explored through a pilot approach in which selected LDC countries that have listed activities on sustainable land management in both their NAPs and their NAPAs receive coordinated services that are comprehensive and consistent across sectors. The LEG was invited to support this initiative by providing technical advice. |  |  |  | 17 |  |  |  | <http://www.unep.org/health-env/pdfs/libreville-declaration-eng.pdf>. 11 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/26 |  |  |  | 47. The WHO representative gave a presentation highlighting the WHO process to strengthen the health components in NAPAs. The contribution of WHO includes: an analysis of current considerations of health aspects in NAPAs; regular feedback to countries |  the secretariat and the GEF and its agencies; proposed strategic and operational frameworks for strengthening the health components of NAPAs; the development and dissemination of health-specific technical guidelines and other tools for national-level planning |  implementation |  monitoring and evaluation; and technical support to countries in building capacity for |  and the planning |  monitoring and evaluation of |  health components of adaptation projects. 48. During the follow-up discussion |  the LEG and WHO recognized that the revision and update of NAPAs would provide an opportunity for integrating information and data relating to comprehensive sectoral assessments |  in particular in the health sector. |  |  |  | J. |  |  |  | Interaction between the Least Developed Countries Expert Group and the Nepalese national adaptation programme of action team |  | 49. In keeping with its practice of interacting with the NAPA team of the country hosting the LEG meeting |  the LEG conducted an interactive session with representatives of Nepal’s NAPA team. Nepal informed the LEG that it had completed its NAPA and that it was due to be launched nationally very soon. The NAPA had been approved by the cabinet and an official submission to the UNFCCC secretariat would be made before the end of 2010. 50. Nepal’s NAPA team presented an overview of the NAPA process |  its institutional arrangements and stakeholder consultations |  and plans for implementation. The presentation showed how Nepal has built on experiences from other LDCs that have completed NAPAs to conduct comprehensive participatory and multidisciplinary activities and integrate inputs from various sectors |  including cross-cutting sectors. Nepal’s NAPA preparation process resulted in the identification of the following sectors as most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change: water and energy; agriculture and food security; forestry and biodiversity; urban settlement and infrastructure; public health; and climate induced disasters. Nepal identified a number of priority projects in this list |  the implementation of which will involve six ministries and two cross-cutting sectors. 51. The team highlighted their close collaboration with bilateral donor programmes |  non-governmental organizations and others during the preparation phase |  in addition to different government ministries. They expressed the hope that implementation would be carried out swiftly |  given the active involvement of all stakeholders during the preparation phase. The additional funding that was sought to complement the LDCF contribution made it possible to develop a NAPA that was more comprehensive than would have been achievable with the LDCF funding alone |  and one that included some references to medium- and long-term strategies |  as well as localized plans for implementation. |  |  |  | III. |  |  |  | Progress in implementation of priority activities of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2008–2010 |  | 52. During the meeting |  the LEG reviewed progress made in implementing its work programme for 2008–2010. A summary of progress made and results is contained in annex I. The LEG noted that it had addressed all of the activities in its work programme for this period. It also noted that support to countries in preparing |  revising and updating |  and |  |  |  | 12 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/26 |  |  |  | implementing NAPAs is ongoing |  and in the event of a renewed mandate |  these core activities would need to be continued. 53. In addition |  the LEG identified the following needs and challenges that could be addressed under an extended mandate for the group through the provision of guidance |  training or technical support |  along with activities identified in other documents available for consideration under this agenda item:18 (a) of NAPAs; (b) Development of programmatic approaches in the implementation strategies Integration of gender-related consideration into NAPA projects; |  |  |  | (c) Mainstreaming of NAPAs into regular development planning in the context of sustainable development; (d) Revision |  implementation and monitoring of the LDC work programme; |  |  |  | (e) Capacity-building for the preparation |  update and implementation of NAPAs and the implementation of the other elements of the LDC work programme; (f) Promotion of synergy with other multilateral environmental conventions and programmes of relevant organizations in the preparation |  update and implementation of NAPAs and the LDC work programme. |  |  |  | 18 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/12 and FCCC/SBI/2010/15. 13 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/26 |  |  |  | Annex I |  | Priority activities of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  2008–2010 |  | Priority activities of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  2008–2010 |  | Activitya Main deliverables and results |  |  |  | Enhance efforts to support least developed countries (LDCs) with special needs in the preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) |  |  |  | Ongoing case files with regular updates on progress made by countries that are still preparing their NAPAs |  with all countries in this group being actively assisted to advance in their NAPA preparation |  |  |  | Provide further support for NAPA preparation • The technical paper was prepared and and implementation through the distribution of distributed to LDC Parties at the thirtieth session of a technical paper on NAPA preparation and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI)b the development of implementation strategies • Provision in the reports of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) and the publicationc of additional information on implementation through the elaboration of some of the steps in the preparation and implementation of NAPAs • Provision in the LEG report to the SBI on its sixteenth meetingd and LEG publicationse of information on the updating and revision of NAPAs |  a programmatic approach and the design of implementation strategies for the full implementation of NAPAs Prepare and disseminate a step-by-step guide for implementing NAPA • The Step-by-Step Guide for Implementing National Adaptation Programmes of Actionf was completed and made available in hard copy as well as electronically in English |  French and Portuguese • In addition |  training materials on NAPA implementation were developed in all three languages Organize training on the design of NAPA • Five regional training workshops were implementation strategies and the preparation conducted of projects based on the information contained • A report of these workshopsg highlights the in the step-by-step guide main issues covered by the workshop |  the emerging issues identified and issues for follow-up and further consideration Conduct a survey of LDC Parties |  United Nations agencies and other relevant actors to collect information on the status of implementation of NAPAs • The survey was completed and results integrated into LEG reports and products |  including the step-by-step guide referred to above • Case studies from LDC Parties on experiences in the preparation and implementation of NAPAs |  including on accessing funds from the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) were also |  |  |  | 14 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/26 |  | Activitya |  |  |  | Main deliverables and results |  |  |  | compiled as a contribution to the assessment of the LDC work programme • The results of the survey and case studies will be integrated into the forthcoming LEG publication on lessons learned and best practice in the NAPA process Conduct capacity-building and outreach activities as requested by Parties at the 2007 stocktaking meeting of the LEG and through surveys Summarize key aspects of NAPAs with a view to identifying key vulnerabilities |  adaptation options by sector and opportunities for regional synergy |  and in order to show evidence of alignment with |  and integration of NAPA activities into |  national development priorities and plans Conduct activities to promote synergy during implementation Ongoing.

Mandate 1. The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by its decision 7/CP.9 |  extended the mandate of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) under the terms of reference adopted by decision 29/CP.7 |  which stipulate that the LEG shall meet twice each year. The work programme for the second term of the LEG (2004–2005) was developed at the fifth meeting of the group |  and was endorsed by the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) at its twentieth session. B. Scope of the note 2. The seventh meeting of the group was held in Bonn |  Germany |  from 4 to 7 April 2005. The meeting included a series of closed sessions followed by an open session with representatives from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and two implementing agencies. This note summarizes the proceedings and outcome of the seventh meeting of the LEG and follow-up action thereon. |  |  |  | II. Operational issues |  | 3. In accordance with paragraph 5 of the LEG terms of reference |  the LEG is to elect annually a Chair |  a Vice-Chair and two rapporteurs from among its least developed country (LDC) members. Because of the language barriers that African Portuguese-speaking LDCs are facing in preparing their national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) |  the LEG agreed to establish a new post of Lusophone Rapporteur. At the seventh meeting of the LEG |  the following officers were elected for a term of one year: (a) (b) (c) (d) Mr. Paul Desanker: Chair Ms. Madeleine Diouf: Vice-Chair and Francophone Rapporteur Mr. Puroshottam Kunwar: Anglophone Rapporteur Mr. Almeida Sitoe: Lusophone Rapporteur. |  |  |  | 4. The group discussed the process of selecting venues for LEG meetings. In the past |  meetings in some LDCs proved to be difficult because of the high travel costs or visa problems. The group therefore decided to develop criteria for choosing meeting locations. These include: level of difficulty in reaching the destination (availability of travel nodes and travel time) |  regional balance |  visa issues including transit visas |  level of key officials expected to open/close the meeting |  avoidance of repetition |  and uniqueness of host-country circumstances. The group also agreed that while it is preferable to hold LEG meetings in LDCs |  a meeting need not necessarily be organized in an LDC Party if it is more appropriate and effective to conduct it elsewhere. 5. The group reviewed intersessional activities and outputs by the LEG. Consistent with the conclusions of the sixth meeting of the LEG |  the following papers were prepared by the LEG and the secretariat for consideration at this meeting: (a) (b) Technical paper: Synergy among multilateral environmental agreements in the context of NAPAs (see section IV.A) Technical paper: Regional synergy in the context of NAPAs (see section IV.A) |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/12 Page 4 (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) Working paper 1: Recommendations for LEG support to Portuguese-speaking countries (see section IV.B) Working paper 2: Cooperation between expert groups under the UNFCCC (see section IV.C) Working paper 3: Update on developments on LDC issues at COP 10 Working paper 4: List of experts (see section IV.B) Working paper 5: Results of the follow-up questionnaire on the status of NAPA preparation (see chapter III) Working paper 6: NAPA implementation strategies (see section IV.D). |  |  |  | 6. The group was updated on decisions adopted at the tenth session of the COP relevant to the LDCs and the LEG and on efforts towards coordination among the different expert groups in the UNFCCC intergovernmental process |  namely the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (CGE) |  the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) |  and the LEG. 7. In this regard the CGE |  through the secretariat |  invited LEG members to provide feedback on the training material developed for the CGE hands-on training workshop on vulnerability and adaptation assessments for the Africa region |  held in April 2005 in Maputo |  Mozambique. The EGTT |  through the secretariat |  invited the LEG to be represented at the seminar on development and transfer of environmentally sound technologies for adaptation to climate change |  held in June 2005 in Tobago |  Trinidad and Tobago |  and to provide the secretariat with names of potential experts who could make a presentation at the seminar. The LEG was subsequently represented in both events. |  |  |  | III. Feedback from the least developed countries on the national adaptation programme of action process |  | 8. On the margins of the twenty-first sessions of the subsidiary bodies and the tenth session of the COP |  the coordinator of the LDC Group |  with support from the secretariat |  circulated to the LDC delegates attending the session a questionnaire on the status of their NAPA preparation. The purpose of this questionnaire was to monitor the evolution of NAPA preparation by LDC Parties and to get an overview on their concerns |  needs and experiences while preparing their NAPAs. The questionnaire was intended to be a follow-up to the first survey conducted six months earlier at the twentieth sessions of the subsidiary bodies |  and to provide feedback to all actors involved in supporting the NAPA process. 9. The questionnaire was completed by 36 LDC representatives. Responses revealed the positive progress made so far by all involved in the NAPA process. Although 11 LDC Parties have not yet formed a national multidisciplinary NAPA team |  14 LDCs are engaging in more advanced steps of the NAPA process. The funds released by the GEF and its implementing agencies have enabled LDC Parties to start the NAPA preparation phase |  and this has contributed considerably to this progress. 10. However |  some difficulties in preparing the NAPAs still remain. Obtaining approval for the NAPA proposal continues to be a slow process. This is evidenced by the fact that since June 2004 |  as many as 17 LDCs have had to revise their estimate of the date of NAPA completion. Of these |  only three are expected to finalize their NAPAs earlier than planned |  and 14 have had to postpone the completion date. Other obstacles include slow disbursement of funds |  administrative procedures of implementing agencies and lack of staff |  time and capacity of national teams to deal with all the NAPA steps. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/12 Page 5 |  |  |  | IV. Completed and ongoing work under the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | A. Promoting synergy among multilateral environmental agreements |  and regional synergy 11. Paragraph 9 (d) of the LEG terms of reference mandates the group to promote synergy among multilateral environmental agreements. In response to a decision by the group at its sixth meeting |  a paper on the promotion of synergy in the context of the work programme of the LEG was finalized. 12. Based on the paper’s recommendation to enhance cooperation |  including with expert groups outside the UNFCCC system |  in particular the Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group on Biodiversity and Climate Change (focussing on adaptation) under the Convention on Biological Diversity |  and the Group of Experts under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification |  the group considered a number of possible options |  such as a regular exchange of work plans and information through linked web sites |  joint meetings |  and even joint implementation of similar activities. In addition |  the group agreed to investigate possibilities for its members to attend workshops on synergy and to establish contacts |  for example under the United Nations University interlinkages initiative |  which could provide valuable insights for the work of the LEG and the NAPA process as a whole. The group agreed to disseminate the document as a technical paper (FCCC/TP/2005/3) for reference by LDCs |  other Parties and agencies that may be willing to support efforts by the LEG in this regard. 13. Paragraph 9 (d) of the LEG terms of reference also mandates the LEG to promote regional synergy. In response to a decision by the group at its sixth meeting |  a revised paper was prepared on regional synergy in the context of the NAPA process. The group agreed to revisit the promotion of regional synergy during the NAPA implementation phase once sufficient NAPAs have been finalized. As to exploring synergy with existing regional networks |  the group will pursue such collaboration under its new activities relating to capacity-building (see section IV.B). The group agreed to disseminate the document as a technical paper (FCCC/TP/2005/4) for reference by LDCs |  other Parties and agencies. B. Capacity-building 14. Paragraphs 1 and 9 (c) of the LEG terms of reference mandate the group to advise on capacitybuilding needs for LDCs for the preparation of NAPAs |  and to provide recommendations thereon. During the sixth meeting |  the group had agreed to consider the barriers that African Portuguese-speaking countries face in preparing their NAPAs. Subsequently a paper was prepared on ways to support Portuguese-speaking LDCs. In addition |  the group was approached by the World Bank (which |  as a GEF implementing agency |  is supporting the NAPA of Sâo Tomé and Príncipe) |  which requested LEG support in identifying a trainer and additional Portuguese-speaking experts to help launch and later support the NAPA process in Sâo Tomé and Príncipe. The group responded to this request and also requested the secretariat to translate the LEG’s annotations to the NAPA guidelines into Portuguese |  and agreed to consider as a next step the possibility of holding a NAPA workshop for lusophone countries. 15. The group had agreed at its fifth meeting to develop a list of local/regional experts on ranking and prioritization |  as part of the LEG’s capacity-building efforts |  for dissemination to the LDCs in support of their NAPAs |  and an initial list was prepared. The group requested the secretariat to ask the proposed experts about their willingness to be included in such a list of experts and to request them to provide their curricula vitae and elaborate on their thematic and regional expertise for NAPA preparation and implementation. After compiling this information |  the secretariat is requested to make the amended list available to the LDCs. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/12 Page 6 C. Cooperation between expert groups 16. At SBSTA 21 |  the SBSTA Chair invited the chairs of the three UNFCCC expert groups to report to him at SBSTA 22 on the progress made in enhancing their cooperation. In response |  a paper was prepared describing possible areas for future collaboration |  including on issues relating to capacitybuilding |  technical advice |  synergy and adaptation. 17. Based on the paper |  the group developed a number of recommendations as a response to the SBSTA request |  including the following: (a) Regarding cooperation with the CGE |  to provide input (i.e. documents |  oral report |  LEG publications |  vulnerability sections of first completed NAPAs) to the April 2005 CGE meeting in Maputo To organize a back-to-back meeting with the CGE in line with the LEG’s terms of reference and to establish a link on adaptation issues. This could include conducting joint meetings and/or workshops and the participation of individual LEG members in CGE workshops To promote the integration of NAPAs (outcomes/results) into second national communications |  for example through promoting the inclusion of members of the NAPA teams into the teams preparing the second national communications Regarding cooperation with the EGTT |  to enhance collaboration on adaptation technologies |  for example through establishing a formal link between the EGTT and the LEG (similar to the CGE link) when reviewing the LEG mandate To link the LEG web site with the CGE and the EGTT web sites on issues relating to adaptation |  to enhance information sharing To identify actions and activities suited for future collaboration when reviewing the work programmes of the expert groups. Activities could include cooperating on authoring technical papers on adaptation technologies and participating in the preparation of a handbook or manual for the assessment and development of project proposals for funding. D. Strategy for implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 18. In response to the LEG terms of reference |  the group had decided at its fifth meeting to prepare a scoping paper to lay out elements for a NAPA implementation strategy. The paper was presented and considered at the sixth meeting of the group. A revised version of the paper was discussed at the seventh meeting |  covering securing financial resources |  institutional arrangements |  further prioritization |  monitoring and impact measurement of proposed activities |  and mainstreaming. The group agreed that a presentation would be made at the informal LDC Fund consultations prior to SBI 22 and that feedback from these consultations and from SBI 22 would be used to finalize the document as a technical paper (FCCC/TP/2005/5). The Chair of the LEG presented the LEG’s approach towards the implementation of NAPAs as input to the informal pre-sessional LDC Fund consultations |  which took place in Bonn |  Germany |  on 13 and 14 May 2005. These consultations were seen by many participants as a positive step in facilitating agreement on further guidance to the GEF on how to operationalize the LDC Fund. 19. The LEG has initiated a review of draft NAPA documents |  at the request of LDC Parties. To date |  the LEG has been requested to review the draft NAPAs of Samoa |  Cambodia and Malawi with the aim of providing comments and suggestions for further improvement. |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | (d) |  |  |  | (e) (f) |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/12 Page 7 20. In an effort to enhance synergy between the NAPA process and efforts towards disaster risk reduction |  the Chair of the LEG participated in a video conference of the Interagency Working Group on Disaster Risk Reduction during SBI 22. The working group agreed to develop a paper in cooperation with the LEG to explore how to encourage synergy during the NAPA implementation phase |  at the community level |  using a country case study. E. Documentation of existing coping strategies 21. At its sixth meeting |  the LEG agreed that work be initiated on developing a database on local coping strategies |  noting the importance of disseminating information on experience in using indigenous knowledge to support the identification of adaptation options by LDCs which share similar climatic conditions. The secretariat updated the group on its work so far. The group requested the secretariat to continue its work and intensify its cooperation with other relevant entities such as IUCN – The World Conservation Union |  which is developing a similar database but with a focus on nature conservation. Strategies included in this database will help countries identify different adaptation options in the implementation phase of NAPAs |  and will also serve as an important input into the identification of opportunities for regional synergy during NAPA implementation. |  |  |  | V. New activities |  | A. Further recommendations on capacity-building needs for preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 22. Building upon previous efforts by the LEG to identify capacity-building needs for NAPA preparation |  and on its current capacity-building activities to support the NAPA teams |  the group identified additional areas of work which could be helpful in supporting the preparation and implementation of NAPAs and which will be initiated after the seventh meeting. These include: (a) (b) (c) Collaboration with regional entities Developing standards and benchmarking for adaptation projects |  which could support the LDCs during the implementation phase in identifying best practices Adaptation workshop(s) in the context of NAPAs. B. Implementing decision 4/CP.10 23. Pursuant to the mandate included in paragraph 1 of decision 4/CP.10 |  the group initiated its consideration of possible elements on the role of the LEG in supporting NAPA implementation. First recommendations include synthesizing project proposals and sharing best practices |  identifying regional synergy |  providing facilitation platforms between implementing agencies and NAPA teams |  providing advice and guidance to bilateral donors on NAPA implementation |  and considering a joint meeting with the EGTT and the CGE to explore issues relating to implementation. The group agreed to further discuss this item at its eighth meeting and to prepare a scoping note. 24. Decision 4/CP.10 |  paragraph 2 |  requested the LEG |  in consultation with LDC Parties |  to include in its report to SBI 23 information on the potential technical and financial difficulties that LDC Parties may have in the implementation of NAPAs. In response |  the group |  supported by the secretariat |  developed and conducted a survey among LDC focal points at SBI 22 |  inquiring about expected technical and financial difficulties with regards to implementation. ----- |  |  |  |

The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by decision 29/CP.7 |  established the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) to advise on the preparation and implementation strategy for national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs). Over the years |  the mandate of the LEG has progressively been expanded and under its current term (2011– 2015) the LEG mandate includes providing support to least developed countries (LDCs) on the NAPAs |  the LDC work programme and the national adaptation plan (NAP) process. 2. In response to decision 6/CP.16 |  the LEG developed a work programme for 2011– 2012 1 at its nineteenth meeting |  which was considered by the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) at its thirty-fourth session. The SBI endorsed the work programme of the LEG for 2011–2012 and requested the LEG to report on its work programme to the SBI at each of its sessions |  2 in accordance with decision 6/CP.16. |  |  |  | II. |  |  |  | Summary of the twenty-first meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | Proceedings |  | 3. The twenty-first meeting of the LEG was held in Thimphu |  Bhutan |  from 9 to 13 March 2012. 4. The COP |  by decision 8/CP.13 |  mandated the LEG to invite |  when deemed necessary |  the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its agencies to its meetings. In addition |  decision 6/CP.16 requested the LEG to engage a wide range of organizations to support the implementation of its work programme. Consequently |  the GEF and four of its agencies: the Asian Development Bank (ADB) |  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) |  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |  and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) took part in the meeting. The LEG extended the invitation to experts from the Earth Institute at Columbia University in New York |  the Regional Climate Change Programme (RCCP) of Southern Africa and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). 5. The meeting was opened by Dr. Ugyen Tshewang |  the Secretary of the National Environment Commission |  on behalf of the Government of Bhutan. He highlighted the value of the work of the LEG to countries like Bhutan where climate change has become a real threat to the population and to the State’s development efforts. He mentioned that Bhutan is at an advanced stage in the implementation of its first NAPA project on glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and that it has also updated its NAPA to take into consideration new climate vulnerabilities |  which have become apparent in recent years. 6. During this meeting |  the LEG focused its work on issues related to the implementation of NAPAs and the LDC work programme |  the strategy for conducting the regional training workshops for 2012–2013 |  the approach for the development of technical guidelines for the NAP process |  and on outreach activities and various case studies to enrich the work of the LEG. The LEG also developed its work programme for 2012–2013. |  |  |  | A. |  |  |  | 1 |  |  |  | 2 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  annex I. A detailed version of the work programme |  including specific objectives |  expected outcomes and a timeline |  is available on the UNFCCC website at <http://unfccc.int/5977>. FCCC/SBI/2011/7 |  paragraph 88. 3 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | B. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Status of preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action |  | Status of preparation of national adaptation programmes of action 7. As at 13 March 2012 |  of the 48 LDCs that had received funding for the preparation of NAPAs |  47 had submitted NAPAs to the secretariat. The latest NAPA |  from Angola |  was submitted in December 2011. Myanmar |  the remaining country |  is making good progress towards the completion of its NAPA. Two LDCs have not requested funding for the preparation of their NAPAs |  namely Equatorial Guinea and Somalia. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Status of implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 8. At the meeting |  the GEF communicated information on the NAPA projects under its consideration to the LEG. As at 13 March 2012 |  43 countries had officially submitted one or more NAPA projects to the GEF in the form of a project identification form (PIF). In total |  58 PIFs have been approved and 33 projects have received endorsement by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the GEF to start project implementation on the ground. Nine projects were endorsed by the CEO during 2011. 9. The GEF indicated that the average time taken between the completion of the NAPA and the approval of the first project by the GEF Council is one year and seven months. The shortest recorded time for this period was 75 days. Twelve countries took less than a year to prepare PIFs that received GEF Council approval. 10. To date |  the following GEF agencies are supporting the implementation of NAPA projects financed by the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF): the African Development Bank (supporting the implementation of three NAPA projects) |  FAO (three) |  International Fund for Agricultural Development (five) |  UNEP (seven) |  UNDP (33) |  UNDP and UNEP jointly (two) |  and the World Bank (six |  including a programmatic approach). 11. As at 9 March 2012 |  25 donors had pledged USD 537.02 million to the LDCF and the GEF announced that the new ceiling for each LDC for implementing NAPA projects had been set at USD 15 million. |  |  |  | C. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Consideration of the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action |  | Accessing project processing information 12. The COP |  by decision 5/CP.16 |  requested the SBI to review |  at its thirty-seventh session |  the experiences of the LDCs with the implementation of the LDC work programme |  including the updating and implementation of NAPAs |  and in accessing funds from the LDCF |  on the basis of submissions received from Parties and relevant organizations and a synthesis report prepared by the secretariat. In addition |  the COP |  by decision 9/CP.17 |  requested the LDCs to provide details on project processing information to the LEG for it to compile and analyse |  with a view to providing the results of the analysis to the COP |  for its consideration at its eighteenth session. 13. Consequently |  during the meeting |  the LEG discussed the possible approaches for collecting project processing information from LDC Parties. It was concluded that the project processing information should include |  inter alia |  all versions and drafts of the project documents submitted to the LDCF |  the final project documents (PIFs and detailed full project documents (FPD)) approved by the GEF |  and when necessary |  the review sheets of the project documents sent by the GEF to the countries and the agencies. It was also agreed that this information will be collected by the LEG through liaison with all the |  |  |  | 4 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | national focal points |  by e-mail |  and/or through interviews conducted during the thirty-sixth sessions of the subsidiary bodies. LDC Parties will be requested to send all relevant information to the LEG by the end of August 2012. 2. Monitoring and evaluation of the preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action and the implementation of the least developed countries work programme 14. The LEG initiated discussions on an approach for monitoring the effectiveness of adaptation efforts in LDCs that are implemented as part of the NAPA process and/or the LDC work programme. The LEG noted the challenging nature of this task given that most NAPA projects have recently begun implementation |  and hence do not yet have data or results to demonstrate their effectiveness on the ground. The LEG |  however |  further noted that other organizations |  such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Resources Institute |  have developed approaches to monitor and evaluate adaptation action and projects. The LEG agreed to do an inventory of such relevant existing work and to develop an approach paper for discussion at its next meeting. |  |  |  | D. |  |  |  | Planning for the regional training workshops for 2012–2013 |  | 15. The LEG discussed the terms of reference of the regional training workshops planned for 2012–2013 |  an outline of the training materials to be used and the potential partners to be involved. The LEG agreed that the workshops will need to build on the previous LEG training workshops and address issues that have emerged since these workshops were held. They need to take into account new templates and requirements for developing projects under the LDCF |  new approaches such as the programmatic approach |  and the emerging opportunities such as combining multiple GEF funds for implementing NAPAs |  among other issues. Furthermore |  drawing upon the issues identified in the work programme of the LEG for 2011–2012 |  3 and upon the additional guidance provided by the SBI at its thirty-fifth session |  4 the LEG agreed on the following broad objectives for the workshops: (a) To enhance the capacity of LDCs to implement NAPAs successfully; |  |  |  | (b) To enhance the capacity of LDCs to undertake processes for medium- and long-term adaptation |  building upon NAPAs; (c) To promote exchange of information |  best practices and lessons learned among the LDCs; (d) To promote gender and other considerations regarding vulnerable communities in the design and implementation of adaptation projects. 16. The LEG also defined a set of outcomes |  which primarily aim at enhancing the capabilities of LDC practitioners to develop projects for implementing NAPAs |  and increasing their awareness and/or knowledge of relevant project development concepts |  gender aspects |  considerations for integrating adaptation into development |  and their knowledge of experiences |  best practices and lessons learned by others in the same region. 17. To support the workshops |  the LEG developed an outline of the training materials to be used at the workshops. Furthermore |  the LEG agreed to consider providing tailored training packages to the workshop trainees |  to enable them to conduct subsequent training at their national levels where feasible. The training materials will include the following |  | 3 4 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  annex I. FCCC/SBI/2011/17 |  paragraph 70. 5 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | modules that can be used in a flexible manner |  in accordance with the needs of each regional workshop: (a) National development processes: how adaptation can be integrated into development processes |  and how to link the two concepts; (b) Assessment of the NAPA: the status of implementation |  quality and need for revision and update; (c) Emerging trends and approaches to implementation: programmatic approaches |  considerations of factors of vulnerability |  etc.; (d) Overview of the GEF/LDCF project cycle including updates on new requirements and enhancements; (e) Accessing funds under the Adaptation Fund: a compilation of existing training materials; (f) Consideration of scale: moving from urgent and immediate needs to mediumand long-term adaptation including through needs assessments |  scaling up |  planning approaches and innovative investments; (g) Exploring synergies with other programmes at the regional and subregional levels (e.g. the Great Green Wall Initiative of the Sahara and the Sahel |  5 the Mekong River Commission Climate Change and Adaptation Initiative |  6 and the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change Project 7 ); (h) (i) Tracking progress: reporting |  monitoring and review; Methodology for capturing and sharing best practices and lessons learned. |  |  |  | 18. The training will target LDC practitioners that deal with NAPAs and/or other adaptation-related activities at the national level |  including those from relevant overarching national planning mechanisms. The design of the workshops will take into consideration regional and language aspects |  including sector-specific issues of interest by each region and the overall progress in implementing NAPAs and/or addressing adaptation. The LEG will engage the GEF and its agencies in the design and implementation of the workshops |  and will solicit collaboration from regional centres and programmes |  organizations that are working on regional programmes |  and regional economic commissions. Closer collaboration will also be instigated with the various bodies under the Convention including the Adaptation Committee |  the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (CGE) and the Technology Executive Committee. 19. The LEG intends to finalize the training materials for the workshops by the end of June 2012 and to conduct the first training workshop in the second half of 2012. The rest of the regional workshops will be conducted during 2013. The LEG estimates that the overall cost of conducting the workshops including the design and preparation of training materials will be approximately USD 800 | 000. |  |  |  | 5 6 |  |  |  | 7 |  |  |  | See <http://www.thegef.org>.

At its nineteenth meeting |  the LEG had identified the execution of case studies on the areas of work of the LEG as one of the tools to carry out its activities and enhance its provision of support. Two case studies were presented at the twentieth meeting of the LEG. The first case study was on Malawi and the second was on the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. 8 The LEG intends to continue conducting case studies in other LDCs and in even greater detail |  with the following objectives: (a) To gather detailed information from LDCs on their experiences |  best practices and lessons learned in preparing and implementing their NAPAs and the other elements of the LDC work programme; (b) To learn |  as well as introduce |  new and innovative concepts such as programmatic/sector-wide approaches |  the integration of gender considerations and considerations of vulnerability |  the issue of scale in adaptation planning |  etc.; (c) To work closely with LDCs to generate |  as well as to gain |  a better understanding of the needs and opportunities for transitioning from the NAPAs towards medium- and long-term adaptation; (d) To identify how countries have started to evolve from project-based adaptation planning to national adaptation plans/strategies; (e) To identify and build upon opportunities for integrating adaptation into national development planning; (f) To promote regional and international synergies including the identification of best practices in terms of regional engagement; (g) To cover any other area that is supported by the LEG. |  |  |  | 21. The case studies will entail undertaking |  including supporting |  the following activities in targeted LDCs: (a) Assembling experiences |  best practices and lessons learned in preparing and implementing NAPAs and the LDC work programme; (b) Identifying and documenting innovative approaches to implement projects at the national |  regional and sectoral levels; (c) Assembling the best available data and information on biophysical and social variables that are useful in characterizing the baseline situation |  and that provide a quantification of key bases for the development of activities; (d) region; Reviewing climate and socio-economic scenarios for the country and/or the |  |  |  | (e) Assessing and documenting relevant national policy processes and frameworks |  plans |  programmes |  including models and strategies for socio-economic growth and development; (f) Performing participatory rapid integrated vulnerability and adaptation assessments and identifying adaptation activities; (g) Undertaking comprehensive analysis and documentation of the data and information related to the design and implementation of medium- and long-term adaptation activities; |  |  |  | 8 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/11 |  paragraphs 43–45. 7 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | (h) Compiling and analyzing considerations for the development of national strategies and plans for adaptation. |  |  |  | F. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Provision of technical guidance and support to the national adaptation plan process |  | Technical guidelines for the national adaptation plan process 22. The COP |  by decision 5/CP.17 |  adopted the initial guidelines for the formulation of NAPs by LDC Parties. 9 It requested the LEG to prepare technical guidelines for the NAP process based on the initial guidelines. 23. The LEG discussed the approach for developing the technical guidelines for the NAP process |  including a timeline. It was agreed that the technical guidelines needed to be flexible and to follow a ‘menu’ approach where country teams would choose components of interest and create their own frameworks or sets of steps that would constitute their NAP process. It was also agreed that certain elements of the ‘menu’ would be essential in laying the groundwork for the NAP process in certain countries. It was felt that the technical guidelines could also encourage the enhancement of capacity in LDCs to carry out the work on their own. This would require a more deliberate delivery and a set of entry points |  rather than applying a fully packaged suite of fixed steps |  as had been presented in past guidelines. 24. It was further agreed that a core set of technical guidelines could be developed for common types of assessments by climate hazard type (floods |  droughts |  storms |  etc.) |  sector (agriculture and food security |  water |  health |  coastal systems |  etc.) |  as well as level (community |  district/region |  national |  shared basin |  etc.) |  and that these could be adapted from existing material |  where possible.. 25. The LEG also agreed that the outputs of the NAP process in each country could include |  inter alia |  progress reports |  a plan or planning document that will be published to communicate the priority adaptation needs |  policies |  programmes and activities for a given national planning period. The NAP process was defined to be broader than just the production of a static national adaptation plan document |  and will include all necessary components of an adaptation approach (such as gap analysis |  capacity-building |  outreach plans |  stakeholder engagement |  and plans for developing concrete policies |  programmes and projects). 26. The discussions highlighted the need to have a sound scientific and technical review of the draft guidelines |  through the mandated review |  by means of a technical review meeting and/or an external peer-review process. Such a process would help to ensure that the guidelines reflect the best available scientific knowledge and expertise with regard to national adaptation planning. The LEG estimated that the review process could be undertaken with the participation of some of the LEG members |  some members of the CGE |  the Adaptation Committee |  academics |  and other relevant experts and representatives of agencies and organizations. 27. In addition |  the LEG set the following timeline for completion of the guidelines: (a) (b) End of April 2012: first order draft; End of May 2012: second order draft; |  |  |  | (c) Beginning of August 2012: scientific and technical review of the advanced draft by a subset of the LEG and external reviewers; |  | 9 |  |  |  | Decision 5/CP.17 |  annex. |  |  |  | 8 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | (d) End of October 2012: final version of the guidelines ready for publication and translation. 2. Examples of ongoing national adaptation planning processes from developed countries 28. The national adaptation planning process being undertaken by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was discussed by the LEG |  to highlight certain lessons that can be considered by LDCs as they embark on their NAP processes. The discussion also served to highlight the differences between national adaptation planning in developed countries to that in LDCs |  particularly in terms of resources |  capacity and support. 29. The LEG considered the case study interesting |  and acknowledged that the way risks were prioritized according to magnitude |  urgency and confidence in data during the vulnerability and risk assessment could be a good model to replicate for medium- and longterm planning in LDCs. The LEG also acknowledged that basing the national plan on a legally binding framework or policy |  as was the case in the United Kingdom |  could assist in both mainstreaming adaptation and creating a sense of ownership by different government departments/ministries. 30. The LEG noted that strong institutional capacities were a relevant component in the United Kingdom example |  and that this was something that LDCs still need to build. In addition |  in contrast to the United Kingdom |  LDCs would need to include one additional step: that of resource mobilization |  particularly in terms of financial resources. |  |  |  | G. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Implementation of the least developed countries work programme |  | Provision of further specification on each of the elements of the least developed countries work programme other than the national adaptation programmes of action 31. The LEG was requested by the COP |  by decision 9/CP.17 |  to provide further specifications on each of the elements of the LDC work programme other than the NAPAs |  in consultation with the GEF |  with a view to informing the COP of guidance to be provided to the GEF on the implementation of those elements. The LDC work programme as established under decision 5/CP.7 contains the following elements: (a) Strengthening existing and |  where needed |  establishing |  national climate change secretariats and/or focal points to enable the effective implementation of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol in LDCs; (b) Providing training |  on an ongoing basis |  in negotiation skills and language |  where needed |  to develop the capacity of negotiators from the least developed countries to participate effectively in the climate change process; (c) Supporting the preparation of NAPAs; |  |  |  | (d) Promotion of public awareness programmes to ensure the dissemination of information on climate change issues; (e) Development and transfer of technology |  particularly adaptation technology (in accordance with decision 4/CP.7); (f) Strengthening the capacity of meteorological and hydrological services to collect |  analyse |  interpret and disseminate weather and climate information to support implementation of NAPAs. |  |  |  | 9 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | 32. The LEG prepared further specifications on each of the elements of the LDC work programme other than the NAPA process. At the meeting |  the LEG and the GEF discussed the specifications including possible ways in which they could be addressed |  with a view to consolidating information that would inform the COP on the guidance to be provided to the GEF. 33. On strengthening existing and |  where needed |  establishing national climate change secretariats and/or focal points to enable the effective implementation of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol |  in the LDC Parties |  it was noted that many LDCs established a national secretariat to oversee the national communication process as well as to manage the NAPA preparation process. In fact |  the completion of their initial national communications was used as the basis for establishing the climate change secretariats. These secretariats are |  however |  at different stages of full functionality. Given the increasing number of climate change activities |  the need is mainly for a permanent or at least a long-term financial support for a secretariat or unit that handles climate change matters on a full-time basis. In some cases |  this could be combined with oversight of other conventions. The national climate change secretariats usually oversee the following functions: (a) Provision of support for the development of a regulatory framework that would underpin a country’s response to the Convention; (b) Regular support for addressing basic human |  institutional and resource needs to coordinate national climate change programmes; (c) Communication of incoming climate change information and requests for input and programmes with relevant stakeholders at the national level. 34. As a way forward |  it was agreed that there is a need to provide adequate support to countries to enable them to strengthen their climate change secretariats. The GEF could contribute to such efforts by developing |  in collaboration with its agencies |  a global programme with a strong component on training aimed at strengthening the capacity of existing climate change secretariats with regard to the implementation of the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol. While developing such a global programme |  the GEF should seek good practices that could be replicated by looking at models of support of secretariats from other multilateral environmental agreements and conventions including the Montreal Protocol. 35. On providing training |  on an ongoing basis |  in negotiating skills and language |  and where needed |  to develop the capacity of negotiators from LDCs to participate effectively in the climate change process |  it was noted that there are past and ongoing initiatives that provide training sessions and capacity-building for developing countries including LDCs. It was also noted that there are LDCs whose needs have not been met |  and which would like to receive further training in negotiation skills and language. It was further noted that the specifications on issues to be addressed under this element could include the following: (a) Means to equip climate change negotiators with up-to-date information on major issues under discussion in the intergovernmental process; (b) Support to initiatives that aim to improve the language skills of climate change negotiators including fellowship programmes and online language courses. 36. It was then concluded that those countries that have remaining needs with respect to negotiating skills and language could |  with the assistance of the GEF and its agencies |  prioritize and communicate such needs for expedited support including through a dedicated support programme. 37. On the promotion of public awareness programmes to ensure the dissemination of information on climate change issues |  it was noted that such public awareness programmes |  |  |  | 10 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | on climate change in LDCs |  building on the lessons learned from the work based on Article 6 of the Convention |  could include the following specifications: (a) Strengthening of existing channels for promoting awareness of climate change issues; (b) Developing and implementing awareness programmes: either education programmes (both formal and informal education) or training programmes for groups with a key role in climate change education and communication (e.g. teachers and journalists); (c) Facilitating public access to information on climate change through the means of websites |  flyers |  newsletters |  etc. |  with translation into local languages. 38. To address these |  it was noted that the greatest limitation is financial resources |  particularly to expand outreach activities from the location of the projects (e.g. NAPAs) to other regions of the country. A possible option was seen as sourcing contributions from each NAPA/adaptation project towards a national pool to support nationwide activities on outreach. 39. On the development and transfer of technology |  particularly adaptation technology (in accordance with decision 4/CP.7) |  the following specifications that would be relevant for the provision of support to LDCs were identified: (a) Conducting technology needs assessments for adaptation at the national |  local and community levels; (b) Strengthening of a technology enabling environment including national institutions for technology innovations and research and technology development; (c) Capacity-building |  including: |  |  |  | (i) The provision of opportunities for training in the use of environmentally sound technologies through demonstration projects; (ii) The enhancement of skills in the adoption |  adaptation |  installation |  operation and maintenance of specific environmentally sound technologies; (iii) Training in project development and the management and operation of climate technologies; (iv) The improvement of knowledge on energy efficiency and the utilization of renewable energy technologies; (d) Strengthening or establishing mechanisms for technology transfer in key sectors including water resources (irrigation |  water management) |  agriculture and food security (integrated soil fertility management |  crop and livestock breeding |  seed production and storage) and coastal zones (the construction of dykes |  afforestation and reforestation of coastal areas). 40. In order to address the above-mentioned issues |  support under the LDCF could facilitate initiatives that would encourage the sharing of information |  experiences |  best practices and know-how on the specifications |  especially at the regional level. Stand-alone projects of a medium- or full-sized nature could be an ideal format for LDCs to access funding for implementing this element of the LDC work programme. 41. On strengthening the capacity of meteorological and hydrological services to collect |  analyse |  interpret and disseminate weather and climate information to support implementation of NAPAs |  it was underscored that data collection is fundamental in building an information and knowledge base to support the analysis and decision-making process for adaptation. It was noted that little progress is reported by LDCs in enhancing |  |  |  | 11 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | their capacity to collect |  analyse and disseminate relevant information. It was also noted that the specifications of this element could include the following: (a) Strengthening the capacity for making observations which could entail modernization |  strengthening and expansion of observational networks and equipment |  including remote sensing |  and the strengthening of regional instrumentation and calibration centres; (b) Strengthening telecommunication systems for the transmission of weather and climate data from the observing platforms to the analysis and processing centres; (c) systems; (d) Capacity-building for forecasting |  post-processing and service production Establishing and/or upgrading data management systems; |  |  |  | (e) Strengthening the efficient communication of climate information from the processing centres to various end users. 42. In order to address this element |  it was suggested that the following options could be explored: (a) LDCF projects are to set aside a specific percentage of their budget towards strengthening national data collection efforts |  beyond the specific area of the project. If this were implemented |  the density of monitoring stations could increase to a useful level |  and ongoing support could be sought through local sources or through contributions from new projects; (b) LDCs are to package their support needs and identified activities |  in particular with regard to facilitating access to climate change data |  into a full-sized project to be submitted for funding under the LDCF. 43. Furthermore |  it was noted that the different components of the LDC work programme hold different levels of priority for different countries |  and the decision on which activities to implement should be made by the country. The LEG also noted that other enabling activities such as the preparation of national communications |  technology needs assessments and other specific activities could have addressed some of the needs under the remaining elements of the work programme. 44. Given the long-standing mandates to the GEF to provide funding for these elements of the LDC work programme |  the following options were proposed to meet country-driven needs: (a) Enabling activities that could be part of a global programme (projects by one or more GEF agencies) for all LDCs with support provided to each country based on their prioritization of the elements of the LDC work programme; (b) Medium- or full-sized projects based on the LDCF resources available to each LDC using existing modalities for implementing NAPA priorities; (c) Whenever it is possible and practical |  the GEF could also facilitate direct access by LDCs for the implementation of the other elements of the LDC work programme other than the NAPA. 45. In cases where activities that are related to certain elements of the LDC work programme have been partially supported |  including through bilateral support |  there is still an opportunity for the GEF to contribute to ongoing efforts as a means of catalysing continuous and predictable support from the international community. |  |  |  | 12 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Strengthening gender and other considerations regarding vulnerable communities within least developed countries 46. As preliminary outputs of its discussion on this matter |  the LEG further identified ways to strengthen gender and other considerations regarding vulnerable communities in adaptation plans and strategies. The group suggested that gender considerations and other considerations of vulnerability could be mainstreamed into policy and planning processes on a country-by-country basis |  given that different LDCs have different vulnerabilities |  and gender-related vulnerabilities are more relevant for some than others. 47. As a way forward on this matter |  the LEG agreed to finalize its paper on gender considerations and considerations regarding vulnerable communities in the implementation of the LDC work programme. The paper will be incorporated into the training materials for the regional training workshops to be conducted in 2012–2013 |  and will also be used to provide technical guidance and support under the NAP process. |  |  |  | H. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Planning for enhanced outreach initiatives and dissemination of products of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | Enhancement of the least developed countries web portal 48. In line with objective six of its work programme for 2011–2015 |  the LEG discussed its plan to enhance the LDC portal. The LEG also took note of decision 5/CP.17 |  paragraphs 36 and 38 |  on the NAP process |  by which the COP requested the secretariat to do the following: (a) Consistent with Article 8 of the Convention |  collect |  compile and synthesize the information needed by the SBI to monitor and evaluate the progress made on the NAP process; (b) Utilize and enhance existing databases |  to include information on support and other activities under the NAP process |  as appropriate. 49. As the LDC portal continues to serve as the main information hub for LDCs on NAPAs and the LDC work programme |  its enhancement will also provide a gateway to information and support for the NAP process through a dynamic and interactive interface. 50. The enhanced LDC portal will include the following components: (a) Enhanced web pages on information about the work of the LEG; |  |  |  | (b) A NAPA information system |  which will feature information on resources which support NAPA preparation and an interactive NAPA implementation project database; (c) A global NAP information system to be designed as a global one-stop information hub about the NAP process in close collaboration with relevant stakeholders. Such an approach will help to prevent the development of numerous websites duplicating work and delivering information that is not always up-to-date. The LEG believes that the design of the NAP information system should encourage the coordination and harmonization of efforts to ensure an efficient and accurate delivery of information and support to LDCs and others preparing and implementing the NAPs. The global information system will also include an accompanying country portal |  which will focus on the national level |  to effectively coordinate NAP related activities and monitor progress; |  |  |  | 13 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | (d) An enhanced best practices and lessons learned platform. The first volume of the publication on best practices and lessons learned 10 contains an initial selection by the LEG and was also displayed on an online platform. 11 The LEG intends to publish additional cases through the LDC Portal on a regular basis. The second volume is planned for the second half of 2012 as more LDCs are interviewed and profiled (see paragraphs 51 and 52 below). 2. Best practices and lessons learned publication 51. The LEG agreed to produce a second volume of the best practices and lessons learned publication by the end of 2012. The publication will focus on the implementation aspects of NAPAs and the LDC work programme |  touching on the following areas: (a) The development of plans for the full implementation of NAPAs; |  |  |  | (b) The issues of co-financing |  setting the baseline of projects and other LDCF related issues; (c) (d) agencies; The accessing of funds other than the LDCF; The relationship with key stakeholders |  in particular the GEF and its |  |  |  | (e) The considerations for the revision and update of the NAPAs |  including expedited approaches to revision and update |  best practices and lessons learned |  and instigating linkages towards medium- and long-term adaptation; (f) (g) The implementation on the ground; The synergies with other programmes and projects. |  |  |  | 52. To this end |  interviews with the LDC NAPA teams will continue during the SBI sessions and at other secretariat meetings to capture relevant experiences and lessons learned. The countries which are to be targeted will be either at an advanced or early stage of implementation. The LEG will also look at countries that have accessed LDCF funding in an expedited manner with little or no bottlenecks. The group will also consider sectoral and geographical approaches. 3. Information to the least developed countries on the work of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group 53. In 2012 and beyond |  the LEG intends to send a regular information note to the LDC Parties |  as a means of further enhancing communication between the LEG and the LDCs. The note will be disseminated in both English and French and sent out four times a year: after each SBI session and each LEG meeting. 54. The first such information note was sent in February 2012. It provided information on the outcome of COP 17 on matters specific to the LDCs and |  on the outcomes of the first year of work under the current mandate of the LEG. 4. Aggregated Least Developed Countries Expert Group publication for 2012 55. The LEG discussed ways to effectively disseminate the results of its work to the Parties |  in particular the various working papers that the group produces prior to each of its meetings. In fact |  these papers provide useful recommendations and advice to LDCs on |  | 10 |  |  |  | 11 |  |  |  | Available at <http://unfccc.int/essential_background/library/items/3599.php?such=j&symbol=FCCC/ GEN/263%20E#beg>. Available at <http://unfccc.int/ 6491>. |  |  |  | 14 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | specific issues related to the preparation or implementation of NAPAs |  other elements of the LDC work programme and the NAP process. The LEG decided to package all these papers into one publication for distribution to Parties. The publication |  which will be ready for COP 18 will include the following themes: (a) Updated guidelines for the revision and update of NAPAs: considerations of sector-specific approaches and multiple timescales for adaptation planning; (b) Unravelling the programmatic approach for NAPA implementation: the GEF and other related approaches; (c) Analysis of the implementation of NAPA: trends and measures of success and benchmarks for key steps and expected outcomes; (d) An approach for monitoring the effectiveness of adaptation efforts in LDCs to reduce vulnerability and adaptation at different scales; (e) Building a knowledge base of common vulnerabilities and practical solutions in addressing vulnerability and adaptation at different scales; (f) Methods and tools used in the formulation and implementation of NAP in different countries; (g) Integrating gender and other considerations regarding vulnerable communities into the design and implementation of activities under the LDC work programme; (h) The role and application of technology in addressing vulnerability and adaptation in LDCs through the NAPA and similar plans and programmes; (i) Promotion of regional synergy in the implementation of NAPA and other elements of the LDC work programme: a revised LEG paper; (j) Progress report on the work of a wide range of organizations and institutions in supporting the implementation of the LDC and the LEG work programmes. 5. Engaging additional regional organizations |  centres and networks in the implementation of the least developed countries work programme 56. The LEG discussed the engagement of regional organizations |  centres or networks |  and such global entities with regional programmes that could add value to the NAP process. The LEG agreed to continue to compile a list of entities to be engaged for this purpose |  drawing upon those engaged in the NAPA process |  partners to the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change |  and any other relevant entities. The LEG emphasized the engagement of entities whose themes and work areas or services could benefit the LDC work programme |  the NAPAs and the NAP process. Such themes |  work areas or services could include networking |  data and information generation and dissemination |  modelling and projections |  training and capacity-building. The LEG further suggested that since such a multitude of these centres |  institutes and organizations exist |  the list could be more focused and prioritized based on the potential impact of their activities on LDCs. The LEG also suggested that priority should be given to those organizations working at the local level and providing concrete outputs within LDCs. The LEG noted that many universities within developing countries offer valuable training |  and that these could also be potential institutions to consider for the implementation of the LDC work programme. |  |  |  | 15 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | I. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Discussion with the Global Environment Facility and its agencies |  | Proceedings 57. The LEG held discussions with the GEF and its agencies on the first and second days of its meeting. The GEF secretariat |  ADB |  FAO |  UNDP and UNEP participated in the discussions. In addition to focusing on further specifications for the other elements of the LDC work programme |  the discussions focused on the latest experiences |  challenges and lessons learned in developing NAPA/LDCF projects and accessing the LDCF. UNDP and UNEP were also given an opportunity to present their proposal for a global support programme to assist LDCs in the NAP process. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Main issues raised 58. The LEG worked together with the GEF and its agencies to find ways to facilitate the implementation of the remaining elements of the LDC work programme by considering a set of specifications and possible ways forward on each of the elements of the work programme. Both the LEG and the GEF and its agencies were committed to seeing progress on this issue and agreed on a number of specific issues. 59. The interaction also provided an opportunity for in-depth discussions on the latest experiences |  challenges and gaps |  and emerging areas of support on developing NAPA projects |  with a view to informing further work of the LEG in support provided to the LDCs. The GEF highlighted the level of access of the LDCF resources by the LDCs by region. At the low end are the small island developing State LDCs which have received 20.5 per cent of the approved LDCF resources |  and on the higher end are African LDCs which have received over 50 per cent of the approved LDCF resources. 60. It was perceived that a number of challenges remained to be overcome |  including the following: (a) Lack of climate data and assessments to make the case for projects; |  |  |  | (b) Difficulties in establishing baselines for projects including the differentiation between the baseline for development and the baseline for adaptation |  and |  the related issue of co-financing; (c) Assessing the effectiveness of adaptation measures: with the adaptation discipline at an early stage |  in particular when it comes to implementation on the ground |  there is |  by default |  a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of adaptation measures; (d) The review process of the GEF used to screen project proposals or project identification forms submitted to the LDCF sometimes went beyond the boundaries of the PIF since some of the comments made by the GEF required very detailed answers |  which were better suited to the FPD formulation phase. Moreover |  on some occasions |  during a follow-up round of review |  the GEF would raise new issues and comments that had never been raised before. 61. The LEG |  the GEF |  and its agencies |  looked at several new lessons from the latest experiences with the implementation of the NAPA. Some of these lessons emerged as the above-mentioned challenges were addressed. These include the following: (a) It is important to demonstrate clearly the benefit of funding a particular project and the positive impact it will have on reducing vulnerability in order to develop a project rationale. This rationale is stronger if the case is built on vulnerability and adaptation assessment based on existing work such as NAPAs |  national communications |  technology needs assessments |  the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a multi-criteria analysis; |  |  |  | 16 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | (b) It is important to develop a strategic results framework at an early stage of the project (i.e. during the project proposal/PIF stage) in order to have a clear idea of the road map for implementation; (c) Projects need to be developed based on a solid baseline with smart indicators and a comprehensive plan for monitoring and evaluation. Existing literature could be used to argue regarding the cost-effectiveness of the proposed options. In parallel |  the international and national communities could pursue work on providing a mechanism to measure the effectiveness of adaptation measures. When it is not possible to have a quantitative assessment of the options |  the assessment could at least be qualitative. Results |  both good and bad |  need to be well documented and archived; (d) It is worth taking stock of ongoing activities and building on lessons learned at each stage of the implementation; (e) Projects will benefit from thorough consultations with relevant stakeholders during the development and implementation phases. The interaction with the stakeholders should be documented and they should be asked to validate every important step of the implementation; (f) Strong interaction between the GEF agencies operating in the country also contribute to improving the project delivery; (g) It is important to ensure that stakeholders’ roles are clarified at an early stage and that all relevant sectors are involved at all stages through a focal point. 62. The discussions also touched upon possible opportunities that could be explored in implementing projects |  including the possibility of scaling up the scope and/or the level of funding by developing a programme rather than a project; opportunity to establish a mechanism which guarantees the continuity of the interventions beyond the lifespan of the project in particular through linking the implementation of NAPAs to the NAP process and maintaining institutions; the need to assist some of the LDCs in funding related issues such as the procurement process and management of funds. 63. As an increasing number of LDCs are moving towards the implementation of the second and subsequent projects from their NAPAs |  several questions were also identified which included: how NAPA implementation projects could be used to attract the private sector and consequently diversify the sources of funding; whether a country could consider NAPA revision before starting the implementation of a second project; how to manage the implementation of projects when the baseline changes. 3. Proposal for a global support programme for the national adaptation plans process 64. UNDP and UNEP presented their joint proposal for a global support programme for the NAP process to assist countries in formulating and implementing their NAPs. The programme proposed by these two agencies comprises three components |  namely: the brokering of knowledge |  institutional support and technical support. The question and answer session that followed the presentation gave an opportunity to UNDP and UNEP to provide clarifications on some of the aspects of their joint proposal. They were also able to obtain feedback from the LEG on the support programme |  which they agreed to use in subsequent iterations of the proposal. |  |  |  | J. |  |  |  | Interaction with other organizations and experts |  | 65. The three organizations invited to the twenty-first meeting of the LEG apart from the GEF and its agencies made a presentation highlighting their areas of work. The |  |  |  | 17 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | presentation made by a representative of ICIMOD focused on its experiences in adaptation in mountainous ecosystems. It also addressed specific phenomena such as GLOFs and the experiences in designing and carrying out outreach and awareness activities for the communities in those areas. The representative of the RCCP of Southern Africa focused her presentation on the experiences of her organization in supporting Southern African countries with respect to the collection and use of data |  information |  models and tools for the adaptation planning and implementation. The representative of the Earth Institute at Columbia University in New York presented the adaptation process of New York State in the United States of America. It included the methodology |  tools |  resources of the project |  the best practices and lessons learned from the experience |  and a view of the applicability of the New York State approach to LDCs. 66. The presentations were followed by a lively question and answer session during which further ideas were generated on possible outputs of the NAP guidelines and on modules for the upcoming LEG regional training workshops. |  |  |  | K. |  |  |  | Interaction with the Bhutan national adaptation programme of action team |  | 67. In keeping with its practice of interacting with the NAPA team of the host country |  the LEG conducted an interactive session with representatives of the Bhutan NAPA team. The Bhutan NAPA team presented progress made in implementing their NAPA |  and shared their experiences |  best practices and lessons learned. The interactive session was enhanced by a visit to Bhutan’s first NAPA project under the LDCF called Reducing climate change induced risks and vulnerabilities from glacial lake outburst floods in the Punakha-Wangdi and Chamkhar valleys. 68. During the visit |  the Bhutan NAPA team made four presentations. The first presentation provided an overview of NAPA preparation and update in Bhutan. The NAPA preparation was undertaken by Bhutan between 2004 and 2006 |  and it has been updated to take into consideration the emerging climate change risks and costing and ranking of the priorities. The updated NAPA will be submitted to the secretariat. 69. The second presentation gave an overview of the above-mentioned project which is at an advanced stage of implementation and is planned to be completed in 2013. This project has three components. The first component addresses disaster risk management. The second one is about the physical lowering of the water level of the Thorthomi Lake to prevent GLOF. The last component is concerned with the establishment of a sound early warning system at the district and community level to reduce human and material losses in vulnerable communities in the Punakha and Wangdi Valleys. Some of the lessons learned from implementing this project include the advantage of having a strong country ownership of such a system and the importance of having an environmentally friendly approach throughout the life of the project and beyond. Among the challenges faced |  it was highlighted that the dependency on the weather and the difficult route conditions make transportation of materials and conduct of the work complex |  including for evacuation in case of emergency. The project received a lot of media coverage which contributed to raising awareness of climate change issues in the country (more information on the project is available on the Bhutan national project web page). 12 70. The third presentation focused on the third component of the GLOF project: the establishment of an early warning system that allows a shift from a manual early warning system to an automatic system. This component involved the expansion of observational |  | 12 |  |  |  | See <www.bhutanglofproject.gov.bt>. |  |  |  | 18 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  |  |  | networks and equipment including remote monitoring stations |  a control room |  several sirens to alert the communities in case of an immediate risk and communication satellites. 71. The last presentation highlighted the key progress in the formulation of a decentralized disaster risk management system that comprises a set of activities based on a multisectoral approach recognizing the clear role of each national executing agency. This last component includes activities such as: comprehensive training of the representatives of the local communities |  a programme aimed at making the local school safer |  awareness raising initiatives through the media or documentary films |  the identification of community disaster focal points and the identification of safe GLOF evacuation areas. 72. During the interaction with the Bhutan NAPA team |  the LEG had the opportunity to visit one of the siren stations and the control room installed as part of the project activities. In addition |  a visit to one of the local communities was organized and a lively interaction with the community chief took place as he explained how his community was organizing itself to cope with climate change related disasters. |  |  |  | III. |  |  |  | Development of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2012–2013 |  | 73. The LEG reviewed the progress made in implementing its work programme for 2011–2012. It integrated the results of this exercise with the new mandates coming from COP 17. As a result |  in addition to the existing activities which are either under implementation or will be implemented in 2012 or 2013 |  the group identified new activities as part of its work programme for 2012–2013.

Mandate |  | 1. The mandate of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) |  under its current term (2011–2015) |  is defined in decisions 29/CP.7 |  6/CP.16 and 5/CP.17. The LEG is mandated to provide technical support and advice to the least developed countries (LDCs) on national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) and the LDC work programme |  and to provide technical guidance and support to the national adaptation plan (NAP) process. 2. In addition to activities under the LEG work programme for 2012–2013 | 1 the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) |  at its thirty-seventh session |  requested the LEG to undertake the following specific activities: (a) To further explore issues of some LDCs related to accessing funds from the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) for the implementation of their NAPAs |  during its meetings with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its agencies |  and to include information on ways and means to enhance the implementation of NAPAs in the reports on its meetings for consideration by the SBI;2 (b) To organize an LDC NAP event in conjunction with SBI 38 |  with the support of the secretariat and in collaboration with relevant organizations. 3 3. In response to decision 6/CP.16 |  paragraph 3 |  the LEG developed a work programme for 2013–20144 at its 23rd meeting. |  |  |  | II. Summary of the 24th meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | A. Proceedings |  | 4. The 24th meeting of the LEG was held in Siem Reap |  Cambodia |  from 26 to 29 August 2013 |  immediately following the regional training workshop on adaptation for Asian LDCs |  which was held at the same location from 20 to 24 August 2013. 5. The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by decision 8/CP.13 |  mandated the LEG to invite |  when deemed necessary |  the GEF and its agencies to its meetings. In addition |  decision 6/CP.16 requested the LEG to engage a wide range of organizations to support the implementation of its work programme. Consequently |  the LEG met with representatives of three GEF agencies |  namely the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) |  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) |  and with the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR). The LEG further solicited relevant inputs from other agencies of the GEF that could not send representatives to the meeting. Two organizations |  the Global Water Partnership (GWP) and Conservation International (CI) |  also took part in the meeting. 6. A member of the Adaptation Committee attended the meeting as part of the collaboration between the two groups on further developing methodologies for identifying |  | 1 2 3 4 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  annex I. FCCC/SBI/2012/33 |  paragraph 67. FCCC/SBI/2012/33 |  paragraph 69. FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  annex II. 3 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/15 |  |  |  | best practices and lessons learned in addressing adaptation in the LDCs.5 A former LEG member |  Ms. Beth Lavender |  also attended the meeting and participated in the discussions on best practices and lessons learned |  and on gender and vulnerable communities. 7. The meeting was jointly opened with the workshop mentioned in paragraph 4 above by Mr. Mok Mareth |  Senior Minister |  Ministry of Environment |  Cambodia. He expressed the Government of Cambodia’s pleasure in hosting the workshop and the LEG meeting. 8. During the meeting |  the LEG focused its work on the following: regional training workshops on adaptation for the LDCs for 2012–2013; plans for further training on NAPs; NAP Expo;6 supplementary materials for the technical guidelines for the NAP process; technical guidance and support to the NAP process; collaboration in providing technical support to the LDCs; outreach on the work of the LEG |  including NAP Central7 and the capturing and sharing of best practices and lessons learned; gender and considerations regarding vulnerable communities within LDCs; monitoring and evaluation of NAPAs |  the LDC work programme and the NAP process; coherence and synergy of adaptation related efforts under the Convention; and the implementation plan for in-depth case studies. It met with GEF agencies on latest updates on |  and experiences with |  support to the LDCs. In keeping with its practice of interacting with the national team of the host country responsible for NAPA and NAP process |  the LEG engaged the Government of Cambodia to share its experience with mobilizing and managing financial resources for addressing climate change. |  |  |  | B. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Status of preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action |  | Status of preparation of national adaptation programmes of action 9. As at 30 September 2013 |  49 LDCs had successfully completed their NAPAs.8 Equatorial Guinea received funding in November 2012 for the preparation of its NAPA |  and is expected to complete it before the end of 2013. 10. Furthermore |  at least three LDCs |  including Bangladesh |  Bhutan and Senegal |  have revised or updated their NAPAs. The LEG stands ready to continue to provide support to the LDCs |  upon their request |  as they continue to rely on technical guidance and advice from the expert group for revising and updating their NAPAs. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Status of implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 11. The GEF reported that |  as of 30 June 2013 |  46 LDCs had officially submitted NAPA implementation project proposals for approval for funding under the LDCF. Of these |  six countries had at least one project approved |  18 countries at least two projects approved and 22 countries had three or more projects approved. 12. The GEF indicated that |  in total |  119 projects9 (comprising seven medium-sized projects and 112 full-sized projects) had been approved by the GEF Council |  with LDCF grants amounting to USD 603.4 million. Of the projects approved |  49 had been endorsed by the Chief Executive Officer of the GEF and are under various stages of implementation. |  | 5 6 7 8 9 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  paragraph 67. FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  paragraph 22. FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  paragraph 26; accessible at <http://unfccc.int/nap>. This also includes Cape Verde and Maldives |  which graduated out of the LDC category in December 2007 and January 2011 |  respectively. Includes one project following a programmatic approach |  the Sahel and West Africa programme in support of the Great Green Wall initiative |  with four projects in Chad |  Ethiopia |  Mali and Togo. |  |  |  | 4 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/15 |  |  |  | 13. The GEF further reported that |  as at 31 July 2013 |  cumulative donor pledges to the LDCF have amounted to USD 774.91 million |  and that the ceiling for each LDC for implementing NAPA projects is USD 20 million |  based on the principle of equitable access. |  |  |  | C. |  |  |  | Regional training workshops for 2012–2013 |  | 14. Two regional training workshops have taken place since the last meeting of the LEG: (a) The regional training workshop for African anglophone LDCs took place from 29 July to 2 August in Kigali |  Rwanda. The workshop was attended by 60 participants from 13 African anglophone LDCs |  two lusophone LDCs (Angola and Mozambique) and one francophone LDC (Haiti). The participants included officers from ministries and departments responsible for the environment |  climate change |  agriculture |  planning |  finance and economics |  meteorology |  water |  land and natural resources. In addition |  seven national focal points of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) |  funded by the CBD secretariat |  attended. Representatives of the following organizations and agencies took part in the workshop and served as resource persons: the GEF and four of its agencies (UNDP |  FAO |  UNEP and the African Development Bank) |  Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development; (b) The regional training workshop on adaptation for Asian LDCs took place from 20 to 24 August 2013 in Siem Reap |  Cambodia. That workshop was the last of the four regional training workshops and was attended by 29 participants from ministries and departments responsible for climate change |  planning and finance. The workshop also included six national focal points of the CBD |  supported by the CBD secretariat. Representatives of the following organizations and agencies took part in the workshop: three GEF agencies (FAO |  UNDP and UNEP) |  UNITAR |  GIZ |  the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development |  the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women and the Southeast Asia START Regional Center. 15. Having completed all the regional training workshops for 2012–2013 |  the LEG discussed experiences and lessons learned from the workshops |  including feedback received from the participants |  and arrived at the following conclusions and recommendations: 10 (a) The training workshops offered an opportunity for participating countries to share practical experiences and lessons learned on adaptation planning and implementation and an opportunity to build networks; (b) The regional nature of the training workshops allowed for each workshop to accommodate targeted input on specific challenges and opportunities for different regions; (c) Regional centres and organizations played vital roles in sharing contextspecific experiences |  given their experience of working with the countries in the respective regions; (d) The presence of the GEF and its agencies throughout the duration of the workshop was valuable as it provided the participants with sufficient opportunity to ask questions and get immediate feedback on issues related to funding and other technical matters; |  | 10 |  |  |  | Further details on the workshops are contained in the synthesis report on the LEG regional training workshops for 2012–2013 (FCCC/SBI/2013/16). The training materials are available at <unfccc.int/7042>. 5 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/15 |  |  |  | (e) The combination of presentations and practical sessions was effective in building and enhancing the participants’ understanding and confidence of NAPA implementation and the NAP process; (f) Participants provided satisfactory feedback on their understanding of the training materials and their potential utilization in respective countries. 16. The LEG discussed the need for a follow-up workshop for the LDCs in the Pacific region to cover the NAP technical guidelines |  since the workshop for that region took place before the NAP technical guidelines were completed. 17. The LEG further decided |  in carrying out further training on the NAP process |  to expand upon and revise the experiences and relevant training materials as necessary. |  |  |  | D. |  |  |  | Plans for further training on the national adaptation plan process |  | 18. The LEG decided that regional training workshops are an effective means of providing training and capacity-building on adaptation to the LDCs. In particular |  this modality allows countries an opportunity to come together and learn from each other and engage with the LEG |  as well as international and regional organizations. 19. The LEG concluded that there is need for continued engagement through regional training workshops |  to support the national-level NAP teams in the execution of the NAP process. The workshops could address issues such as access to financial resources |  stocktaking |  integration of adaptation into sectoral and other development planning processes |  and the development of adaptation plans and programmes. In planning the series of workshops |  the LEG also noted the need to consider how the Pacific LDCs can be trained on the NAPs |  since their workshop happened prior to the completion of the technical guidelines for the NAP process. 20. The LEG recommended that regional training workshops be continued and that a new round of workshops be initiated in the second half of 2014. 21. The LEG also concluded that the training materials provided a good basis for the regional training workshops |  and that in carrying out further training on NAPs |  there will be a need to further develop and expand the training materials as necessary. It also considered developing training materials that could be packaged as e-learning materials for self-paced training and for training of trainers. |  |  |  | E. |  |  |  | NAP Expo |  | 22. The LEG discussed key aspects and feedback from the NAP Expo |  which was held on 11 June in conjunction with the thirty-eighth sessions of the subsidiary bodies. The LEG noted that the NAP Expo was attended by more than 150 participants |  including from the LDCs and other Parties |  the GEF and its agencies |  United Nations organizations |  international and regional organizations |  development agencies |  and regional centres and networks. Furthermore |  the Chair of the SBI |  Mr. Tomasz Chruszczow |  the Executive Secretary |  Ms. Christiana Figueres |  and Mr. Prakash Mathema |  representing the LCDs |  addressed participants at the opening of the Expo. 23. The LEG also noted that the NAP Expo provided a good opportunity for the LDCs to share their experiences and needs with the LEG |  LDCs and other Parties |  and with the organizations and agencies present at the Expo. Similarly |  agencies |  organizations and Parties were able to share information on available and planned support for the LDCs for the NAP process. |  |  |  | 6 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/15 |  |  |  | 24. Overall |  the LEG concluded that the NAP Expo was successful in delivering its intended objectives and |  in response to requests from LDC Parties |  decided to organize a similar outreach event in 2014 that would aim at contributing to enhanced understanding of the NAP process and how LDCs can work with different stakeholders on their NAP processes. The LEG will further deliberate on the timing |  nature and scope for the next expo. |  |  |  | F. |  |  |  | Supplementary materials for the technical guidelines for the national adaptation plan process |  | 25. The LEG continued its discussions on supplementary materials to support NAP processes that build on the NAP technical guidelines.11 It acknowledged that a NAP is a flexible |  iterative |  and continuous process that will need and attract support from various sources |  including sectoral experts |  regional experts and expert groups. It welcomed initiatives from different organizations on providing supplementary materials that would assist the LDCs in achieving concrete steps on the NAP process. It agreed to look for ways |  on a case-by-case basis |  to assist in the development of supplementary materials. The LEG will concentrate on the link with NAP technical guidelines. It elaborated the following general recommendations for the development of the supplementary materials: (a) The supplementary materials need to be aligned with the LEG NAP technical guidelines |  but need not follow the steps as presented in the technical guidelines. It is important to recognize the flexible nature of the NAP process; (b) They would need to focus on being useful at the practical level (i.e. be brief |  be technical and provide examples on how to address the specific issue/topic); (c) Contributing organizations need to ensure broad input from all relevant organizations in developing the supplementary materials; (d) The LEG may assist in identifying examples |  case studies |  best practices and lessons learned to be used; (e) The LEG strongly encourages broad participation on the development of supplementary material |  including the involvement of end users. 26. The LEG noted that supplementary materials on water |  health |  ecosystems and agriculture and food security are at various stages of development. The LEG will continue to offer its assistance to various proponents of the supplementary materials |  as appropriate. |  |  |  | G. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Technical guidance and support to the national adaptation plan process |  | Information paper on how national adaptation plan processes can be supported in the least developed countries 27. The LEG worked on the outline of an information paper on how NAP processes can be supported in the LDCs |  forming part of the work of the LEG on collaboration with relevant organizations in providing technical guidance and support to the LDCs on the NAP process. 28. The LEG decided that the primary audience for the paper would be the GEF and its agencies |  bilateral agencies |  international organizations and regional centres and networks. The paper will be anchored on the work of the LEG on support needs for the NAP process12 |  | 11 12 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  paragraph 16. FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  paragraphs 17–19 |  and FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  paragraphs 17 and 18. 7 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/15 |  |  |  | and will address financial |  technological and capacity-building support |  as well as aspects relating to scientific knowledge |  data and analysis. 29. 2. The LEG decided to prioritize the paper and complete it by the end of 2013. |  |  |  | Support needs for the national adaptation plan process 30. The LEG discussed progress in its activities in addressing the support needs for the NAP process listed in the report on its 23rd meeting.13 The LEG noted that some of the needs are being addressed |  including through the work on the following: (a) Dissemination of the technical guidelines for the NAP process |  as elaborated in chapter II.G.4 below; (b) Development of supplementary materials for the NAP guidelines |  as described in chapter II.F above; (c) Training on introduction to the NAP process through the LEG regional training workshops for 2012–2013 |  as referred to in chapter II.C above; (d) Further development of NAP Central |  as described in chapter II.G.3 below; (e) Development of a tool for monitoring and evaluation of NAPAs |  the LDC work programme and the NAP process |  referred to in chapter II.J below; above. (f) Proposed regional training workshops on NAPs |  referred to in chapter II.D |  |  |  | 3. |  |  |  | Supporting the national adaptation plan process through NAP Central 31. The LEG discussed further design aspects of NAP Central |  building on the discussion at the NAP Expo and the developments made since then. It agreed that the scope of NAP Central is to provide a universally accessible |  web-based central repository and hub for information pertinent to the NAP process. The main target audience comprises NAP teams in developing countries |  with a particular focus on the LDCs. The LEG further elaborated key content and functionalities of NAP Central |  which would include the following: a database of information relevant to the NAP process; links to relevant information of organizations |  regional centres and networks |  non-governmental organizations and research institutions on support for the NAP process; a blog to enable sharing of stories |  ideas and announcements; a wiki-based synthesis of scientific information and data by country |  and other functionalities that would enable intuitive navigation through the system |  such as the possibility of sorting the information by hazard |  sector or region/country; and country portals. 32. The LEG finalized the terms of reference for the support group on the design and implementation of NAP Central over the next two years. The support group will be composed of four members of the LEG |  a member of the Adaptation Committee |  and representatives of the GEF and its agencies |  other United Nations organizations and research organizations. The support group will request further input from regional centres and organizations working in the LDCs |  as well as consult with NAP country teams as appropriate. The LEG will continue to enhance NAP Central through the support group. |  |  |  | 4. |  |  |  | Outreach and awareness raising on the application of the technical guidelines 33. The LEG has thus far released the technical guidelines |  an outreach document summarizing the NAP process |  a poster and a CD-ROM of those materials. These are available in three languages (English |  French and Portuguese) from the secretariat and |  | 13 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  paragraph 18. |  |  |  | 8 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/15 |  |  |  | online as part of NAP Central.14 An online interactive version of the technical guidelines has also been developed under NAP Central. The LEG agreed to continue efforts to enhance outreach and awareness on the application of the technical guidelines |  including through the following: the dissemination of the technical guidelines to Parties during the sessions of the subsidiary bodies and the COP and other related events; and enhancement of the online interactive version of the technical guidelines with relevant supplementary materials and case studies. 5. Progress report on support to the national adaptation plan process 34. The LEG discussed progress reports on support to the NAP process provided by United Nations organizations |  specialized agencies and other relevant organizations |  as well as bilateral and multilateral agencies |  regional centres and networks |  with a view to finding an effective manner in which such information could be collected and disseminated. The LEG decided not to provide fully comprehensive and complete information |  but to focus on providing an overview of such support. The LEG noted that comprehensive reporting is being undertaken through other channels |  such as through reports on fast-start finance. The LEG agreed that such information would need to be collected as frequently as possible |  through regular interactions with organizations and groups as well as recipient countries. 35. The following are selected highlights of support given to the LDCs on the NAP process between March and September 2013: (a) The LEG has released the technical guidelines for the NAP process and is working with organizations that engage in developing supplementary materials as described in paragraph 25 above. The LEG is further developing tools |  case studies and methods to support the LDCs on the NAP process. NAP Central has also been developed to house information on the NAP process and to serve as a collaboration platform. The LEG also introduced the NAP process at the NAP Expo and in the regional training workshops; (b) The GEF Council |  in response to the request from COP 18 for the GEF to enable activities for the preparation of the NAP process by the LDCs |  has adopted a paper operationalizing support to the LDCs for the NAP process. The GEF indicated that LDCs can start to access funds from the LDCF for their NAP processes; (c) Various organizations |  including FAO |  UNDP |  UNEP |  the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Health Organization (WHO) |  have communicated ongoing programmes that would directly contribute towards strengthening the capacity of the LDCs in launching and leading the NAP process. The support ranges from data and information at the sectoral levels to sector-specific methods and tools |  and includes programmes for strengthening capacity in managing the NAP process and for integrating climate change adaptation into sectoral policies and programmes |  as well as into relevant planning processes and strategies; (d) A support programme on NAPs has been developed by UNDP and UNEP |  together with the GEF secretariat |  IFAD |  the World Food Programme |  UNITAR and the United Nations Office for Project Services |  in collaboration with WHO. The programme establishes a support mechanism around three main pillars: institutional support |  technical support and knowledge brokering. The programme goal and objective will be achieved by the following: (a) developing operational road maps and implementing training to advance NAP processes in the context of LDC national development strategies; (b) making tools and approaches available to LDCs to support key steps in the NAP process; and (c) exchanging lessons learned and knowledge through South–South and North–South cooperation; |  | 14 |  |  |  | <http://unfccc.int/nap/>. 9 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/15 |  |  |  | (e) Relevant support from developed country Parties presented in the reports on fast-start finance.15 |  |  |  | H. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Outreach on the work of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | Best practices and lessons learned 36. The LEG discussed and finalized terms of reference for an advisory group for further developing methodologies for capturing best practices and lessons learned in addressing adaptation in the LDCs. The advisory group will be composed of two LEG members |  a member of the Adaptation Committee and a member of the LDC Group delegated by the Chair of the LDC Group. The advisory group will work in close consultation with the GEF and its agencies |  other United Nations organizations |  research institutions and regional centres and organizations working in the LDCs. 37. The LEG subsequently decided to publish a third volume of the best practices and lessons learned publication once the revised methodology becomes available. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Outreach publication on national adaptation programmes of action: success stories 38. The LEG noted that LDCs and the GEF and its agencies have highlighted the value of sharing success stories about NAPAs |  especially on the outcomes of completed projects or those under implementation. The LEG decided to develop an outreach publication on success stories. |  |  |  | I. |  |  |  | Gender and other considerations regarding vulnerable communities within the least developed countries |  | 39. The LEG discussed gender considerations and considerations regarding vulnerable communities in the implementation of the LDC work programme with a view to producing publications on the issues. The LEG agreed to first develop a publication with a focus on gender |  which will address the operational details of how to integrate gender into the NAP process. It will address the following issues: understanding gender-sensitive adaptation; methods for integrating gender considerations into adaptation; and integration of gender into the NAP process. 40. The LEG decided to produce a first draft of the publication by the end of 2013 and to have the publication finalized by the fortieth sessions of the subsidiary bodies. The LEG decided that the publication will be produced in close consultation with gender experts |  agencies and organizations |  taking into account relevant experiences and examples. 41. The LEG also decided to prepare a separate publication on vulnerable communities subsequent to the publication on gender. |  |  |  | J. |  |  |  | Monitoring and evaluation of national adaptation programmes of action |  the least developed countries work programme and the national adaptation plan process |  | 42. The LEG discussed early design concepts for further developing a tool for monitoring and evaluating progress |  effectiveness and gaps (the PEG M&E tool) in the NAPAs |  the LDC work programme and the NAP process at the national and global levels |  |  | 15 |  |  |  | Available at <http://www3.unfccc.int/pls/apex/f?p=116:8:2477421744968317>. |  |  |  | 10 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/15 |  |  |  | building on its previous work on the subject.16 It decided to produce a draft technical paper outlining how the PEG M&E tool can be used as an immediate next step towards fully developing the tool. The PEG M&E tool is intended to provide operational guidance on monitoring and evaluation at the national level and will seek to maximize synergy with detailed monitoring and evaluation work at the project and programme levels |  as well as with broader work on adaptation. 43. The PEG M&E tool will be applied to the following 10 essential functions that the NAP process should deliver to countries: (a) Helping governments to provide national leadership and coordination of adaptation efforts at all levels and to act as the main interface with regional and international mechanisms; (b) The collection |  compilation |  processing and dissemination of data |  information and knowledge on climate change and relevant development aspects in support of adaptation planning and implementation; (c) Identifying and addressing gaps and needs related to capacity for the successful design and implementation of adaptation; (d) Assessing climate development linkages and needs and supporting the integration of climate change adaptation into national and subnational development and sectoral planning (through policies |  projects and programmes); (e) Analysing climate data and assessing vulnerabilities to climate change and identifying adaptation options at the sector |  subnational |  national and other appropriate levels; (f) Appraising adaptation options to support decision-making on adaptation investment plans and development planning; (g) Promoting and facilitating the prioritization of climate change adaptation in national planning; (h) Facilitating the implementation of adaptation at all levels through appropriate policies |  projects and programmes |  taking into account opportunities for synergy; (i) Facilitating the monitoring |  review and updating of adaptation plans over time |  to ensure progress and the effectiveness of adaptation efforts and to demonstrate how gaps are being addressed; (j) Coordinating reporting and outreach on the NAP process to stakeholders nationally and internationally on progress to the Convention. 44. The LEG will look at how each of those essential functions needs to be supported by structural capacity in the countries and at what kind of targets and indicators countries could set |  based on which progress towards the full enablement of the functions could be monitored. 45. The LEG will consider a full prototype of the tool by December 2013. The LEG will then test the tool through a case study |  review it and produce a technical paper to introduce it by its next meeting (March 2014). |  |  |  | 16 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  paragraph 43. 11 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/15 |  |  |  | K. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Support of coherence and synergy of adaptation under the Convention |  | Linkages with other bodies under the Convention 46. Following an invitation by the Adaptation Committee |  the LEG nominated one of its members to serve in the Adaptation Committee’s ad hoc group on modalities and guidelines for NAPs for non-LDC developing countries. The Adaptation Committee also nominated two of its members to be part of the advisory group for further developing the methodologies for capturing best practices and lessons learned in addressing adaptation |  and for the development of NAP Central |  on the invitation of the LEG.17 47. In addition |  the LEG participated in the 5th meeting of the Technology Executive Committee |  and in an expert meeting on technology road maps |  which were both held in March 2013 in Bonn |  Germany. 48. The LEG decided to share updates on progress in the implementation of its work programme with the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (CGE) |  through its members that are also members of the CGE. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Revision of the technical paper on regional synergy 49. The LEG discussed an approach for the revision of its technical paper on regional synergy |  which was developed in 2005 | 18 with a broadened scope to cover NAPAs |  the LDC work programme and the NAP process. The LEG noted that the paper would need to address the following: (a) options for promoting common approaches in addressing adaptation; (b) access to and use of data |  methods and tools at the regional level; (c) sharing of experiences |  best practices and lessons learned; and (d) exploring and promoting economies of scale. The LEG noted that the paper would also need to address the role of the LEG in regional synergy and the LEG strategy for promoting regional synergy. Key partners in undertaking this work would include national institutions |  regional organizations |  centres and networks. |  |  |  | 3. |  |  |  | Revision of the technical paper on synergy among multilateral environmental agreements 50. Similar to the revision of the technical paper on regional synergy as described in paragraph 49 above |  the LEG discussed an approach for revising its technical paper on synergy among multilateral environmental agreements |  which was developed in 2005.19 The LEG discussed that the paper should draw on existing work undertaken under the three Rio Conventions |  including by the Joint Liaison Group between the secretariats of the conventions. The LEG discussed that the revised paper could also look at synergy with other international agreements such as the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat (Ramsar Convention). The LEG decided to finalize the revised paper by June 2014. |  |  |  | L. |  |  |  | Mobilization of organizations |  regional centres and networks |  | 51. The LEG discussed its ongoing efforts on mobilization of organizations |  regional centres and networks with a view to exploring ways on how to engage others that have not been engaged before |  ensuring a balance across regions and issues. It decided to continue to |  | 17 18 19 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  paragraph 44. FCCC/TP/2005/4. FCCC/TP/2005/3. |  |  |  | 12 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/15 |  |  |  | reach out to a wide range of organizations |  regional centres and networks in supporting LDCs |  taking into account feedback from the participants during the regional training workshops on the value of engaging regional entities. 52. The LEG noted the need to reach out to organizations |  regional centres and networks on how they could contribute to the work of the LEG |  as a way to ensure that their inputs are aligned with the work of the LEG and with the work on support to the LDCs under the Convention. 53. The LEG also noted that the engagement of organizations |  regional centres and networks does not only contribute to the specific activities of the LEG but also sensitizes those organizations regarding the work that LDCs are doing on NAPAs and NAPs and of the LEG |  and the support needs of the LDCs in this regard. The LEG noted that this would encourage those organizations to raise awareness on the work of the LEG and to address LDC needs through their own initiatives. |  |  |  | M. |  |  |  | Discussion with the Global Environment Facility and its agencies |  | 54. The LEG held discussions with representatives of three GEF agencies (FAO |  UNDP and UNEP) that had taken part in the LEG regional training workshop for Asian LDCs that took place just before the LEG meeting. The discussion touched on the latest efforts in providing support to the LDCs for the implementation of NAPAs and the LDC work programme |  with a focus on support for launching NAP processes at the national level in the LDCs. 55. The agencies provided an update on progress on the global support programme for the NAPs for the LDCs. It was indicated that subsequent to the approval of the project by the GEF for funding |  the following activities were undertaken to move the support programme forward: (a) An online survey was administered to determine country-specific priority needs for advancing the NAP process.20 The survey received 150 responses from around 56 countries |  of which 40 were LDCs; (b) The board of the global support programme met on 16 and 17 August in Bangkok |  Thailand |  to discuss its workplan and budget. At the same meeting |  the board offered support to all countries that requested support; (c) A roster of international technical specialists in climate change adaptation |  public administration |  economics and related fields is being set up to ensure that specialists are at hand that will support efforts led by UNDP and UNEP on capacity-building in the LDCs to integrate adaptation into national and sectoral development planning; (d) Coordination is being advanced with partner agencies to ensure that all available support activities to countries that are relevant for NAPs are leveraged to support as many LDCs as possible. 56. The global support programme is planned to run for two years |  starting from 2013. 57. The LEG provided feedback to the agencies to ensure that the global support programme works towards maximizing support to all LDCs and that the global support programme takes into account country-specific needs |  circumstances and progress that may have already been made. 58. Representatives of UNDP and UNEP also mentioned that a second project is planned that aims at supporting the LDCs on the implementation of the other elements of |  | 20 |  |  |  | <http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/NAP-GSP_EN>. 13 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/15 |  |  |  | the LDC work programme other than NAPAs. The agencies agreed to share the latest documents with the LEG for comments and inputs. 59. The representatives also highlighted the activities aimed at strengthening the capacities of the LDCs to address adaptation at the national level. 60. The LEG and the agencies agreed to continue to collaborate on supporting the LDCs and to continue to explore ways and means to engage other agencies that were not present at the meeting. The agencies agreed to report on progress on the global support programme to the LDCs through the LEG. |  |  |  | N. |  |  |  | Interaction with other organizations and experts |  | 61. The LEG also engaged three other organizations at the meeting |  namely CI |  GWP and UNITAR. 62. CI and GWP were engaged on the work on supplementary materials for the technical guidelines. The two organizations presented material to the LEG that could be considered for the supplementary materials. The LEG provided feedback to the organizations in line with the guidelines for the supplements presented in chapter II.F above. 63. UNITAR was engaged in order that the LEG could learn more about its work and how it could potentially benefit the LDCs. The representative of UNITAR highlighted how it provides learning through various means. The LEG took note of UNITAR’s activities for supporting learning and agreed to consider them when discussing different training approaches. |  |  |  | O. |  |  |  | Interaction with the Government of Cambodia on the national adaptation programme of action and the national adaptation plan process |  | 64. Representatives of the Government of Cambodia shared their experiences on mobilizing and managing climate finance as a way to provide examples on how other LDCs may learn from their experiences in mobilizing and managing financial resources for the NAP process. They indicated that Cambodia has mobilized over USD 200 million from multilateral and bilateral agencies and from ongoing projects and programmes at the national level. Through the Cambodia Climate Change Alliance |  a multidonor trust fund of USD 11 million has been established under the national climate change committee with interim management by UNDP. The fund supports a policy and knowledge management project at the national level and 20 pilot projects at the subnational level. It promotes partnerships between the government and non-governmental organizations |  including universities |  in order to build capacity to address climate change. The representatives explained the value of pooling resources into a trust fund |  which included reduced transaction costs and management requirements |  and assurance that funding is aligned with national priorities. Cambodia also highlighted its pilot activities on integrating climate finance in subnational plans and budgets. 65. The LEG took note of the experiences of Cambodia and agreed to consider them on relevant case studies to feed into the NAP process. |  |  |  | 14 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/15 |  |  |  | III. Modalities for implementing the Least Developed Countries Expert Group work programme for 2013–2014 |  | 66. The LEG further discussed the most appropriate modalities for implementing its work programme for 2013–2014 in order to enhance support provided to the LDCs |  strengthen collaboration with other organizations and to promote effective outreach. It decided to undertake the following specific activities |  as a way to facilitate work on core technical issues |  and in line with the complementary approaches for the delivery of the work programme as elaborated during its 23 rd meeting:21 (a) Development of a comprehensive strategy for future training on NAPs that would include revision and expansion of topics to be covered |  and development of training materials |  including those that can be delivered through e-learning as well as materials suitable for training of trainers. Those materials would be developed in collaboration with other organizations; (b) Work to support interested organizations in their development of supplementary materials to the NAP technical guidelines |  by applying the guiding recommendations in chapter II.F above; (c) Implementation of in-depth case studies in the LDCs that address topics and issues covered in the LEG work programme |  in order to inform |  enrich and test the various products that are under development (such as the technical papers |  tools and information systems); (d) Development of technical and information papers to inform the work by the LEG on NAPAs |  the LDC work programme and the NAP process; (e) Development of NAP Central to facilitate outreach and support efforts of the LEG and to offer a platform for exchange of experience and interaction among NAP teams; (f) Deliberation on some of the activities of the LEG at a technical meeting in early 2014 |  involving invited experts |  in order to further elaborate on technical aspects. |  |  |  | 21 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/8 |  paragraph 67. 15 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2013/15 |  |  |  | Annex |  | Members of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group as at 29 August 2013 |  | Mr. Abias Huongo Mr. Ibila Djibril Mr. Thinley Namgyel Mr. Matti Nummelin Mr. Mphethe Tongwane Mr. Benon Bibbu Yassin Mr. Batu Krishna Uprety Mr. Jan Verhagen Ms. Marianne Karlsen Mr. Douglas Yee Mr. Fredrick Manyika Mr. Paul Abiziou Tchinguilou Ms. Pepetua Election Latasi Angola Benin Bhutan Finland Lesotho Malawi Nepal Netherlands Norway Solomon Islands United Republic of Tanzania Togo Tuvalu |  |  |  | 16 |  |  |  |

Mandate |  | 1. The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by its decision 29/CP.7 |  established the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) to advise on the preparation and implementation strategy for national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) |  and adopted the terms of reference of the LEG. According to these terms of reference |  the LEG is to convene twice each year |  and report on its work to the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI). 2. In response to decision 8/CP.13 |  the LEG developed |  at its thirteenth meeting |  a work programme for 2008–2010 | 1 which was considered by the SBI at its twenty-eighth session. The SBI |  at its thirtieth session |  requested the LEG to keep it informed of the efforts of the LEG in implementing its work programme over the period 2008–2010.2 The LEG further developed |  at its sixteenth meeting |  a list of priority activities for 2010 | 3 which were considered by the SBI at its thirty-first session. |  |  |  | II. Summary of the seventeenth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | A. Proceedings 3. The seventeenth meeting of the LEG was held in Bonn |  Germany |  from 12 to 14 April 2010. |  |  |  | 4. The COP |  by its decision 8/CP.13 |  decided that the LEG may invite |  when deemed necessary |  the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its agencies to its meetings. Furthermore |  the SBI |  at its twenty-eighth session |  encouraged the LEG to seek to ensure the complementarity of its activities under its work programme with related efforts by the GEF |  its agencies and other relevant entities.4 To this end |  representatives of the GEF and three of its agencies – the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) |  the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) – participated in the seventeenth meeting. 5. During the meeting |  the LEG focused its work on reviewing the status of NAPA preparation and implementation |  progress in implementing priority activities of the LEG work programme for 2010 |  and on interacting with the GEF and its agencies in reviewing support being provided to those countries still preparing their NAPAs and efforts towards an effective full implementation of NAPAs. In the review of its work programme |  the LEG paid particular attention to: support available to Least Developed Country (LDC) Parties for the implementation of NAPAs and the finalization of preparation where it is pending; monitoring and assessment of the LDC work programme |  the NAPA process and the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF); and the compilation of experiences |  best practices |  lessons learned and gaps in the NAPA process and the LDC work programme. The LEG also discussed potential issues that could be addressed by the group under a possible new mandate after 2010. |  |  |  | 1 2 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/6 |  annex I. FCCC/SBI/2009/8 |  paragraph 59. 3 FCCC/SBI/2009/13 |  annex I. 4 FCCC/SBI/2008/8 |  paragraph 47. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/5 Page 4 B. Status of preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 6. On the status of preparation of NAPAs |  as at 12 April 2010 |  44 NAPAs had been submitted to the secretariat |  and four (Angola |  Myanmar |  Nepal and Timor-Leste) of the 485 LDCs that had received funding for the preparation of NAPAs had yet to submit completed NAPAs. Two LDCs |  Equatorial Guinea and Somalia |  are yet to access funding for preparing their NAPAs. 7. On the status of the implementation of NAPAs |  the GEF reported on NAPA projects under its consideration. As at 12 April 2010 |  16 projects in Bangladesh |  Benin |  Bhutan |  Burkina Faso |  Cambodia |  Cape Verde |  Democratic Republic of the Congo |  Eritrea |  Maldives |  Mali |  Niger |  Rwanda |  Samoa |  Sudan |  Tuvalu and Zambia had received endorsement by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the GEF |  and at least 13 projects in Cambodia |  Comoros |  Djibouti |  Gambia |  Guinea |  Guinea-Bissau |  Haiti |  Lao People’s Democratic Republic |  Lesotho |  Liberia |  Malawi |  Sierra Leone and Vanuatu are expected to be endorsed by the CEO of the GEF before the end of 2010. A total of seven project identification forms (PIFs) have been approved by the CEO of the GEF and the GEF Council from Kiribati |  Mali |  Mauritania |  Samoa |  Sao Tome and Principe |  United Republic of Tanzania and Yemen |  and six more PIFs are pending clearance by the CEO and approval by the GEF Council. 8. Six countries have submitted a NAPA and are preparing PIFs (Central African Republic |  Chad |  Madagascar |  Mozambique |  Togo and Uganda) |  and two countries have yet to start the preparation of a PIF in cooperation with a GEF agency (Afghanistan and Ethiopia). 9. To date |  the following GEF agencies are currently supporting the implementation of NAPA projects: UNDP (supporting the implementation of 29 NAPA projects) |  World Bank (four) |  UNEP (five) |  IFAD (two) |  the African Development Bank (one) |  UNDP and UNEP jointly (two) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (one). 10. The representative of the GEF informed the LEG that an adjustment is made to the amount of funding available to each LDC under the LDCF on a continuing basis |  based on available resources. Given the current levels of funds in the LDCF |  LDC Parties are able to access up to USD 6 million from the LDCF to fund NAPA projects. Currently |  there are no specific instructions for accessing additional funds in cases where an LDC Party had previously accessed some funds from the LDCF. The LEG explored the relative merits of three possible options: prepare additional proposals to the LDCF; revise proposals in the pipeline to request more funds; or expand and scale up an existing activity to cover more target communities. C. Consideration of priority activities of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2010 1. Enhanced support to countries in the preparation stage 11. The LEG discussed the progress made by the countries that are still preparing NAPAs and agreed to continue to identify and resolve problems as they arise. Members of the LEG were assigned to follow the specific cases of Angola |  Equatorial Guinea |  Myanmar |  Nepal and Timor-Leste to ensure that any remaining obstacles are removed and that resource materials are provided to the NAPA teams as they carry out their work. The LEG discussed progress in each of these countries based on case files prepared for each country |  and noted that good progress is being made in all cases towards completion of a NAPA in the near future. The LEG decided to develop a case study on how to prepare a NAPA alongside a first national communication |  based on the situation of Equatorial Guinea |  and proposed to collaborate with |  | 5 |  |  |  | Cape Verde received funds to prepare a NAPA |  but has since graduated from the LDC group. The current total number of LDC Parties to the UNFCCC is 49. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/5 Page 5 the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (CGE) if this could be incorporated with the CGE’s new work plan. 2. Supporting the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 12. The LEG has developed a number of publications to guide LDCs in implementing their NAPAs. The publications are intended to provide consistent guidance on developing NAPA projects and facilitate collaboration between the LEG and the GEF and its agencies when responding to requests by the SBI for technical support and training. 13. The “Step-by-Step Guide for Implementing National Adaptation Programmes of Action”6 (hereafter referred to as the Step-by-Step Guide) was completed and is available in English |  French and Portuguese. It includes a “Quick Guide” to accessing the LDCF. It was used at the training workshops on implementing NAPAs that took place on 19–23 October 2009 in the United Republic of Tanzania |  and on 8–12 February 2010 in Mali. It has been distributed to LDC Parties and the GEF and its agencies during the LEG/NAPA side event that took place on 3 November 2009 in Barcelona |  Spain |  and the thirty-first session of the SBI that took place in Denmark in December 2009. 14. The LEG developed training materials based on the Step-by-Step Guide to guide the training workshops. A paper on “Support needed to fully implement NAPAs”7 was finalized and published at the thirty-first session of the SBI. 15. The above publications |  as well as past LEG publications |  guidance from the COP on matters relating to LDCs |  information from relevant workshops and other relevant materials relating to NAPAs |  have been compiled into a “NAPA Source Kit” CD-ROM. The CD-ROM is available as a separate publication and is being widely distributed to all Parties. 16. The LEG discussed feedback from the first two training workshops and identified lessons to be learned when planning for the remaining three workshops. Feedback from the Francophone LDCs included a request that the GEF allow NAPA project documents to be submitted and processed in French. If this was not possible |  the Francophone LDCs proposed that GEF project templates and guidelines |  including sample log-frames and model project documents |  be translated into French to facilitate learning. In addition |  feedback from the two workshops indicated a desire by all LDCs to fully implement their NAPA and to develop a holistic implementation strategy that addresses the whole NAPA as a coordinated programme. This programme could then be implemented in phases depending on available funding under the LDCF and other sources |  to improve coordination of projects and avoid delays associated with the development of single projects from PIF to project preparation grant (PPG) and full project document for each project being funded under the LDCF. This approach for implementing the whole NAPA is described in the Step-by-Step Guide |  and is introduced to LDC Parties during the NAPA training workshops currently underway. 17. The next training workshop on NAPA implementation for the Asian LDCs is planned to be held in Vientiane |  Lao People’s Democratic Republic from 4–8 May 2010. Two more workshops are planned for Lusophone and the Pacific LDCs respectively |  and will be conducted during the second half of 2010. Upon request from the SBI | 8 the GEF has provided USD 600 | 000 from the LDCF as a contribution towards the costs of these training workshops |  to supplement contributions being made by Parties. |  |  |  | 6 7 |  |  |  | <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/ldc_napa2009.pdf>. <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/09_ldc_sn_napa.pdf>. 8 FCCC/SBI/2009/L.27 |  paragraph 13. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/5 Page 6 3. Monitoring and assessing the least developed countries work programme |  national adaptation programme action process and the Least Developed Countries Fund 18. The LEG discussed progress made in implementing the mandate for the assessment of the NAPA process |  access to the LDCF and the implementation of the LDC work programme.9 Terms of reference for conducting these assessments were adopted by the SBI at its thirty-first session. The LEG discussed a process for choosing country case studies to ensure a broad representation of issues covering both the preparation and implementation of NAPAs. 4. Outreach efforts and mobilization of other agencies in support of the least developed countries 19. The LEG discussed ways to improve its outreach to Parties |  especially LDCs. The LEG agreed that the LDC Portal should be enhanced |  and that it should include information on the status of NAPA implementation |  lists of NAPA projects currently being implemented |  funding available under the LDCF for each LDC Party for implementing NAPAs |  information on other sources of funding |  and outreach and awareness-raising materials on NAPAs and the LDC work programme for use by LDC Parties. 20. The LEG also discussed collaboration with relevant expert groups |  programmes and agencies. The Chair of the LEG will meet |  under the guidance of the Chair of the SBI |  with the Chairs of the CGE and the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) to discuss ways to promote synergy and collaboration in supporting LDCs. The Chair of the LEG |  if requested |  will provide information on the NAPA process to the Adaptation Fund Board. The LEG will continue to foster synergy and cooperation with the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change. 21. The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to hold a 4th United Nations Conference on LDCs in 2011.10 Recognizing the importance of this Conference |  the LEG agreed to submit a written contribution on NAPAs and the LDC work programme to the preparatory process of this Conference. 22. The United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) is implementing a project under the European Union Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA) which aims to help the most vulnerable developing countries increase their capacity to adapt to the effects of climate change |  in support of the achievement of the millennium development goals (MDGs). UNITAR has expressed a keen interest to learn from the LEG and to cooperate in activities to support LDCs. The LEG agreed to be prepared to provide assistance to UNITAR in implementing activities under the GCCA. 23. The LEG was briefed on a request from the secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) to the secretariat of the UNFCCC for collaboration in promoting synergy in the implementation of National Action Programmes to combat desertification and the NAPAs. The UNCCD has invited suggestions from the LEG on the choice of pilot countries. 24. The LEG also discussed the science platform being developed by the Global Change System for Analysis |  Research and Training (START). The platform |  named Africa DIVA |  will use LDCs and NAPAs as a pilot to develop a dynamic scientific assessment portal for adaptation. The LEG agreed to be ready to provide information on NAPAs as and when this may be necessary |  including suggesting how START can further support LDCs through its programmes. |  |  |  | 9 10 |  |  |  | Decision 5/CP.14 |  paragraphs 4 |  5 and 10. United Nations General Assembly resolution A/RES/63/227. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/5 Page 7 25. The LEG deliberated on how some of the small-scale |  community-based projects that were submitted through the World Bank Development Marketplace11 can be implemented in LDCs to enhance NAPA implementation. The LEG concluded that these projects could provide a platform for small-scale |  stand-alone adaptation projects given their innovative and concrete nature. The LEG decided to introduce this into a dialogue with the GEF and other potential donors with a view to seeking possible ways of implementing such stand-alone |  small projects through the LDCF or other programmes. 5. Further elaboration of guidance to least developed countries Parties 26. As part of its work |  and in response to an invitation by the SBI at its twenty-ninth session |  the LEG developed an approach on how LDC Parties can update priorities in their NAPAs |  which would lead to revisions of the list of projects and project profiles |  and how to submit such updates and revisions of the NAPA to the secretariat. The LEG decided to encourage LDC Parties to take advantage of this approach and update their NAPAs. 27. The LEG also stressed that a solid implementation strategy is crucial to achieving full implementation of NAPAs. In updating and revising the NAPA |  the LEG highlighted the following issues that could be enhanced or addressed by NAPA teams (the LEG will also consider distributing more information notes on these topics |  subject to the time available in the remainder of its mandate): (a) Preparation for full implementation of the NAPA using a programmatic approach as appropriate |  such as through a scaled approach (development of a prototype project then expanding its implementation when more funds become available without having to write additional proposals from the beginning) |  a sequential approach (implementing parts of the programme in stages over time |  again as more funds become available) |  or through a segmented approach (design implementation of the whole NAPA but implement distinct components based on availability of funds); Elaboration of baseline activities relevant to the whole NAPA (ongoing development and related activities in the areas targeted by the NAPA priority projects) in sufficient detail in the NAPA to assist in demonstrating co-financing during project development under the LDCF; Inclusion of a strategy for fund-raising that looks beyond the LDCF to fully implement the priorities in the NAPA |  in the case where the LDCF would not have sufficient funding |  in order to address the urgent and immediate needs in the NAPA as quickly and effectively as possible; Updating the costs of the priority activities |  especially in cases where the NAPA is more than two years old |  since costs would have changed |  and levels of vulnerabilities would have changed as well (in most cases for the worst); Elaboration of the integration of proposed project activities into existing national programmes and activities |  as well as ongoing global and regional efforts in related areas |  such as in the case for improving the collection |  analysis and dissemination of climate information to support development and early warning systems |  such as under disaster-preparedness programmes at national and regional levels. |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | (d) |  |  |  | (e) |  |  |  | 11 |  |  |  | <http://www.developmentmarketplace.org>. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/5 Page 8 6. Documenting experiences |  best practices |  lessons learned and key conclusions to be drawn from the national adaptation programmes of action process and the least developed countries work programme 28. The LEG discussed a preliminary outline of work to capture and communicate best practices |  lessons learned and key conclusions to be drawn from the NAPA and the LDC work programme. The approach in this exercise focuses on framing lessons based on experience in a manner that will facilitate application in future areas |  actively allow learning from experience and avoid past mistakes. A set of core issues to be investigated will be developed from various documents and reports on LDC matters and the LDCF. 29. The approach will build on inputs from different stakeholders through debate and dialogue and other applicable methods. It will identify the domain of the problem |  the target audience for each core issue |  and clear solutions that can be implemented. The results of this exercise will be prepared into a publication and disseminated through presentations and briefings at relevant gatherings and meetings |  and targeted correspondence to appropriate officers in direct lines of command. 30. The LEG noted that the regional training workshops provide an excellent opportunity for collecting information on experiences and lessons learned from experts from LDC Parties. The LEG agreed that the country case studies described in paragraph 19 above could also be used to collect additional information from NAPA teams. 7. A proposed approach for the Global Environment Facility to implement paragraph 2 of decision 5/CP.14 31. At its fourteenth session |  the COP requested that the GEF |  in parallel with supporting the ongoing implementation of the NAPAs |  facilitate the implementation of the remaining elements of the LDC work programme. The GEF requested that the LEG |  at its sixteenth meeting |  provide ideas on how this mandate could be implemented. The LEG proposed an approach that provides funding |  through the enabling activity window |  to all LDCs to implement priority activities from the remaining elements of the LDC work programme |  based on national needs |  through a global project that expedites access to resources. 32. In addition |  to ensure continuity of support |  the LEG proposed that each LDCF project set aside a percentage of its budget towards supporting the other elements of the LDC work programme |  and for project reports to include explicit reporting on the support provided as part of regular project monitoring and reporting. 33. Furthermore |  the LEG proposed that the GEF consider developing a data policy for GEF funded projects to ensure that the data collected contributes to national data collection efforts |  and is shared freely and openly with national entities in a reasonable time soon after the data is collected and processed. To this end |  the LEG also proposes that all GEF adaptation projects make special efforts to collect climate data in order to improve observational networks in LDCs. 8. Elements for a future mandate of the least developed countries expert group 34. The LEG reviewed its work programme for 2008–1010 and identified activities that the group is unlikely to complete before its term ends in 2010. These activities could be continued under a new work programme if the LEG mandate is to be renewed |  and include inter alia: (a) (b) Promotion of regional synergy in the implementation of NAPA projects; Exchange of experiences and lessons learned at the regional level; |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/5 Page 9 (c) Technologies for adaptation. |  |  |  | 35. In addition |  the LEG brainstormed on possible elements that could be addressed in a new mandate: (a) Technical support and guidance for the revision and updating of NAPAs to meet present day challenges and incorporate the results of implemented NAPA projects |  the lessons learned and best practices; Enhanced capacity-building of LDC Parties to fully implement NAPAs through the provision of guides |  training workshops |  and other technical support designed to improve |  among other things |  Parties’ access to the LDCF and other sources of funding |  including through direct access modalities such as the Adaptation Fund (AF); The capacity of national institutions and adaptation focal points to enable the effective implementation and monitoring of national adaptation plans and programmes in the LDCs; Technical guidance and advice on the preparation of national adaptation plans including the identification of possible sources of data and its subsequent application and interpretation; Technical guidance and advice on the implementation of national adaptation plans in vulnerable countries |  including on the design of programmatic approaches and integration of climate change adaptation into development planning and programmes; Development and transfer of adaptation technologies; Guidelines on mainstreaming adaptation by aligning national adaptation plans with government planning and budgetary processes. Technical support and development of supporting tools for implementation |  including sector thematic guidance on how to integrate adaptation into development and how to address adaptation within key economic sectors; Public awareness programmes to ensure the dissemination of information on climate change issues at the national level; Knowledge management and outreach activities aimed at sharing good practices and lessons learned from preparing and implementing NAPAs; Information exchange on NAPAs |  the LDC work programme and synergies with other multilateral environmental conventions; Promotion of South–South partnerships in supporting the implementation of the LDC work programme; Advise on revision of the LDC work programme and the scope of capacity-building for LDCs and other vulnerable countries; Provision of advice and support to developing countries in the preparation and design of adaptation programmes |  upon request. |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | (d) |  |  |  | (e) |  |  |  | (f) (g) |  |  |  | (h) (i) (j) (k) (l) (m) |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/5 Page 10 D. Interaction with the Global Environment Facility and its agencies 1. Proceedings 36. The LEG allocated the first day of its meeting to interact with the GEF and its agencies. The GEF |  IFAD |  UNDP and UNEP participated in the meeting. 37. Discussions focused on updates on the progress made in NAPA preparation and implementation; feedback and emerging support needs from the regional training workshops; implementation of the other elements of the LDC work programme; and elements of future collaboration between the LEG and the GEF and its agencies. 2. Main issues raised 38. The LEG introduced the discussion on the status of preparation and implementation of NAPAs and pointed out that LDC Parties continued to mention their difficulty with the issue of co-financing for NAPA projects during the recent NAPA training workshops and at SBI side events. The LDC Parties have indicated that they fully comprehend the concept of co-financing |  however |  they find the application of decision 3/CP.11 |  on determining additional costs for adaptation and the use of the sliding scale |  to be an issue. The GEF further elaborated on what co-financing means under the LDCF |  and that NAPA projects would need to be purely concerned with adaptation for them be exempt from the need for cofinancing. 39. It was noted that the limit on the amount of funding each LDC Party could access is dynamic and changes over time when new pledges are made to the LDCF. The LEG pointed out that there is no systematic way for the GEF to inform LDC Parties of any changes to the limit. It was suggested that changes to this limit |  and methods for LDCs to access additional funds |  be communicated to all UNFCCC and GEF focal points |  in addition to this information being shared with GEF agencies during their monthly adaptation task force meetings. The LEG also proposed to assist in communicating this information to LDC Parties through the LDC Portal. 40. In the context of the value of exploring a programmatic approach to implementing NAPAs |  the LEG encouraged the GEF and its agencies to support LDCs in implementing NAPAs as programmes in addition to the single project approaches currently in use. Such programmes would increase the effectiveness of interventions when they are fully integrated into sectoral and other national activities and programmes. The LEG proposed that agencies enable LDC Parties to develop programmatic implementation strategies for the whole NAPA through the PPG that is currently awarded for each project under the LDCF |  to facilitate the full implementation of NAPAs. 41. In a survey conducted by the LEG of the LDC Parties |  use of local/national experts versus international consultants during the design and implementation of projects was identified as a best practice. It benefits project design and implementation since local/national experts have a better knowledge of the local situation and needs |  and their engagement contributes to overall capacity building and ownership of projects. The LEG recommended that the GEF agencies use local/national experts/consultants during the project design phase. 42. The LEG updated the agencies on monitoring the implementation of NAPAs and the LDC work programme |  including an assessment mandated to take place at the sixteenth session of the COP. The agencies showed a keen interest in providing information on their activities in support of the implementation of NAPAs and the LDC work programme |  and encouraged the LEG to provide an informal template for information that would be most relevant to the monitoring and planned assessment. The LEG agreed to prepare and distribute this template to the agencies. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/5 Page 11 43. As LDCs pursue other sources of funding |  including from other funds managed by the GEF |  the issue of co-funding an activity from the LDCF alongside another GEF source or the AF has been raised by the LDCs. Currently |  it is not possible to combine sources of funding from more than one GEF window under one project. The LEG invited the GEF to consider this issue and offer guidance as necessary. This will become particularly relevant as LDCs start to access the AF and the Special Climate Change Fund to implement NAPA activities |  as well as in developing projects that may have both mitigation and adaptation benefits. 44. It was noted that there are many useful lessons to be drawn from the NAPA process that could inform ongoing discussions on the implementation of adaptation. The LEG is planning to document the results of this exercise in a publication to be widely distributed to all stakeholders. The LEG emphasized the need for more collaboration among the GEF and its agencies |  LDC parties |  and other stakeholders in fulfilling this task. 45. Finally |  it was noted that despite being invited |  a number of GEF agencies were still unable to attend the LEG meetings. The LEG committed to continuing its efforts to encourage participation by the other GEF agencies |  and encouraged the GEF help mobilize support for the LEG from the other agencies. |  |  |  | III. Progress on priority activities for implementation for 2010 |  | 46. In response to a request by the SBI at its twenty-eighth session | 12 the LEG considered which activities in its work programme for 2008–2010 should be given priority. A list of priority activities is presented in annex I to document FCCC/SBI/2008/14. At its sixteenth meeting |  the LEG reviewed progress made in implementing its work programme and identified a list of additional actions needed in 2010. At its seventeenth meeting |  the LEG further reviewed progress made in implementing the priorities for 2010 and made plans to complete consideration of all tasks before the end of its mandate in 2010. An update of progress made and expected outputs for 2010 is contained in annex I. |  |  |  | 12 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/8 |  paragraph 50. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/5 Page 12 |  |  |  | Annex I Actions to implement updated priority activities of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2010 |  |  |  | Activity Enhance efforts to support least developed countries (LDCs) which have special needs with regard to the preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) |  |  |  | a |  |  |  | Further support for NAPA preparation and implementation through the preparation of a technical paper on NAPA preparation and the development of implementation strategies |  |  |  | Progress made since LEG 16 Case files opened on five LDCs that are yet to submit their NAPAs.

Mandate |  | 1. The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by its decision 29/CP.7 |  established the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) |  initially for a period of two years. Subsequently |  the COP extended the mandate of the group three times |  twice for a period of two years (decisions 7/CP.9 and 4/CP.11) and once for a period of three years (decision 8/CP.13). Then the COP |  by its decision 6/CP.16 |  extended the mandate of the LEG for five more years. 2. In response to decision 6/CP.16 |  the LEG developed a work programme for 2011– 20121 at its nineteenth meeting |  which was considered by the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) at its thirty-fourth session. The SBI endorsed the work programme of the LEG for 2011–2012 and requested the LEG to report on its work programme to the SBI at each of its sessions | 2 in accordance with decision 6/CP.16. |  |  |  | II. Summary of the twentieth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | A. Proceedings |  | 3. The twentieth meeting of the LEG was held in Vientiane |  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic |  from 12 to 14 September 2011. 4. The meeting was opened by Mr. Khampadith Khammounheuang |  the Deputy Director General of the Department of Environment of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment |  on behalf of the Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. In his opening remarks |  he highlighted the progress made by the country in implementing its priority national adaptation programme of action (NAPA) projects. 5. Following the resignation of the Chair of the LEG |  Mr. Fredrick Kossam (Malawi) |  in April 2011 and in accordance with paragraph 5 of the terms of reference of the LEG | 3 at its twentieth meeting the LEG elected the current Vice-Chair |  Ms. Pepetua Election Latasi (Tuvalu) |  as the new Chair of the LEG. The group then elected Mr. Batu Uprety (Nepal) as the new Vice-Chair. Mr. Uprety is also the Anglophone Rapporteur. 6. The LEG focused its work at its twentieth meeting on several technical and information papers that the group had planned to discuss at that meeting |  with a view to producing advanced drafts and finalizing them before COP 17. For each paper |  three to four members of the LEG took the lead and provided guidance and inputs. The papers included a technical paper on the identification and implementation of medium- and long-term adaptation activities in the least developed countries (LDCs) (see paras. 15–17 below). A shortened version of that paper was presented at the expert meeting on national adaptation plans (NAPs) that took place also in Vientiane |  the Lao People’s Democratic Republic |  just after the twentieth meeting of the LEG |  from 15 to 17 September 2011. The other papers cover the following themes: programmatic approaches to NAPAs and other related adaptation plans and strategies; gender-related and other considerations regarding |  | 1 |  |  |  | 2 3 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  annex I.

The LEG also focused on other issues |  in particular on its work priorities up to its next meeting |  and interacted with members of the climate change team of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. |  |  |  | B. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Status of preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action |  | Status of preparation of national adaptation programmes of action 7. As at 14 September 2011 |  of the 48 LDCs that had received funding for the preparation of NAPAs |  46 had submitted NAPAs to the secretariat. The latest NAPA |  from Timor-Leste |  was submitted on 13 September 2011. The two remaining countries (Angola and Myanmar) are making good progress towards the completion of their NAPAs. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Status of implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 8. With regard to the status of implementation of NAPAs |  the Global Environment Facility (GEF) communicated to the LEG soon after its twentieth meeting information on the NAPA projects under its consideration. As at 12 September 2011 |  46 countries had officially submitted one or more NAPA projects to the GEF |  in the form of a Project Identification Form (PIF). In total |  49 PIFs had been approved and |  following the approval of those PIFs |  33 projects had received endorsement by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the GEF to start their implementation on the ground. Seven projects were endorsed by the CEO during 2011. 9. To date |  the following GEF agencies are currently supporting the implementation of NAPA projects financed by the LDCF: the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (supporting the implementation of 28 NAPA projects) |  the World Bank (four) |  the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (six) |  the International Fund for Agricultural Development (five) |  the African Development Bank (three) |  UNDP and UNEP jointly (two) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (three). 10. As at 31 March 2011 |  23 donors had pledged USD 324 million to the LDCF | 4 and cumulative net funding approved by the GEF Council and the CEO amounted to USD 109 million.5 11. Some initiatives outside of the Convention |  such as the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) of the Climate Investment Funds and the Africa Adaptation Programme (AAP) of Japan and UNDP |  have built on the NAPA process in order to provide additional support to the LDCs for adapting to the adverse effects of climate change. For instance |  five LDCs |  namely Bangladesh |  Cambodia |  Nepal |  Yemen and Zambia |  that are currently implementing their NAPAs are also taking part in the PPCR. Eight other LDCs |  namely Burkina Faso |  Ethiopia |  Lesotho |  Malawi |  Rwanda |  Sao Tome and Principe |  Senegal and United Republic of Tanzania |  are implementing their NAPAs while also taking part in the AAP. Two LDCs |  namely Mozambique and Niger |  are concurrently implementing their NAPAs and taking part in the PPCR and AAP. A summary table showing the status of |  |  |  | 4 |  |  |  | 5 |  |  |  | See the Status Report on the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Special Climate Change Fund of March 2011 (GEF/LDCF.SCCF.10/Inf.2) |  available at <http://www.thegef.org/gef/node/4397>. As footnote 4 above. |  |  |  | 4 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/11 |  |  |  | implementation of NAPAs and the LDCs that are participating in the PPCR and AAP is provided in annex I to this document. |  |  |  | C. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Consideration of the priority activities of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2011 |  | Provision of support to the least developed countries for the preparation |  revision and update of their national adaptation programmes of action 12. The LEG agreed to continue to assist those LDCs that have not yet submitted their NAPAs (Angola and Myanmar) |  in order for them to complete their NAPAs as soon as possible and catch up quickly with the implementation process. To that end |  the LEG decided to continue monitoring the progress files for each of those LDCs |  in order to facilitate the tracking of progress and the identification and mitigation of any possible bottlenecks. The monitoring of progress files was also extended to cover all the LDCs and to track the NAPA implementation process. 13. The work programme of the LEG for 2011 includes the preparation of updated guidelines on how countries can revise and update their NAPAs |  taking into account the latest developments in and opportunities for longer-term adaptation planning. At its twentieth meeting |  the LEG decided to postpone the delivery of those guidelines until 2012 |  in order to take into account the consideration of medium- to longer-term adaptation and the outcomes of the discussions on NAPs at SBI 35. 14. In the meantime |  as part of its monitoring activities |  the LEG agreed to start capturing experiences and lessons learned from those countries that have updated or revised their NAPAs. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Provision of technical advice and guidance on the identification of medium- and longterm adaptation needs and the implementation of identified adaptation activities 15. The LEG had prepared for its twentieth meeting a draft of a technical paper on the identification of medium- and long-term adaptation needs |  integration of adaptation into development planning |  and the implementation of identified adaptation activities in the LDCs |  to be presented at SBI 35.6 The paper takes into account sector-wide and programmatic approaches |  and builds on the NAPA process. 16. During its meeting |  the LEG further refined the paper. It also prepared a shortened version and a related PowerPoint presentation. Both were presented by the group at the subsequent expert meeting on NAPs |  communicating the following key messages: (a) adaptation; The NAPAs provide a good starting point for medium- and long-term |  |  |  | (b) Medium- and long-term adaptation requires an iterative process with stages or phases that may be designed to suit specific national circumstances; (c) Medium- and long-term adaptation is more policy driven |  and therefore effective integration into development planning becomes more important; (d) Medium- and long-term adaptation does not replace the need to address urgent and immediate needs; (e) A significant body of material is available for guiding the adaptation process |  although it may need to be tailored and supported by targeted training. |  | 6 |  |  |  | FCCC/TP/2011/7. 5 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/11 |  |  |  | 17. Furthermore |  the LEG had collected available information on approaches and steps already used by different countries in designing and implementing adaptation plans |  strategies or frameworks. In addition |  the LEG had used a case study approach and engaged the climate change teams of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Malawi in order to better understand what medium- to long-term adaptation activities could entail and what possible steps could be followed to identify and implement medium- to long-term adaptation activities. The case studies are ongoing |  but their preliminary results and the information collected on existing approaches used by different countries were summarized to inform the technical paper. 3. Sharing of best practices and lessons learned from the least developed countries work programme 18. The LEG recognized that the first volume of the publication on best practices and lessons learned in addressing adaptation in the LDCs through the NAPA process | 7 hereinafter referred to as the publication on best practices and lessons learned through the NAPA process |  was close to completion. It planned to make it available at SBI 35 |  in English |  French and Portuguese. 19. The first set of best practices and lessons learned identified by the LEG and captured in the publication are as follows: (a) NAPAs are widely viewed as a success story; |  |  |  | (b) The NAPA approach allows countries flexibility in terms of design and implementation; (c) Engaging stakeholders from the NAPA preparation stage in implementation and other subsequent steps has many advantages; (d) Envisioning the involvement of NAPA teams in the long term helps raise awareness and ensures the continuity of adaptation programmes and activities in countries; (e) Regular interaction between the LEG and the LDCs has been very useful; |  |  |  | (f) Good relations between the GEF agencies and the NAPA teams result in the smoother implementation of NAPA projects; (g) Designing a thorough implementation strategy can improve the effectiveness of NAPA implementation; (h) The simplified LDC project cycle provides expedited access to resources; |  |  |  | (i) Adaptation planning with an initial focus on urgent and immediate needs can be effectively undertaken based on existing knowledge. 20. The LEG discussed its participation in the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries |  held in Istanbul |  Turkey |  in May 2011 |  at which a member of the LEG shared experiences |  best practices and lessons learned in relation to the LDC work programme with high-level conference participants. The group also discussed the design of the platform on best practices and lessons learned and agreed to continue the discussion on that topic at its next meeting. |  |  |  | 7 |  |  |  | <http://unfccc.int/essential_background/library/items/3599.php?such=j&symbol= FCCC/GEN/263%20F#beg>. |  |  |  | 6 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/11 |  |  |  | 4. |  |  |  | Provision of information to the least developed countries on programmatic approaches to national adaptation programmes of action and other related adaptation plans and strategies 21. In its efforts to support the LDCs in fully implementing their NAPAs |  the LEG included as part of its work programme for 2011–2012 an activity to develop an information paper on a programmatic approach to implementing NAPAs |  in collaboration with the GEF and its agencies. 22. At its twentieth meeting |  the LEG held very lively discussions that led to the production of an advanced draft of the paper. The information paper provides a review of the current definitions of the programmatic approach. It also presents examples of programmes on the global |  regional and national scales |  with a view to informing the LDCs on ways to effectively design programmes for implementing NAPAs and other related adaptation plans. 23. The LEG decided to work on finalizing the paper soon after its meeting and intended to complete it before SBI 35. 24. In its initial conclusions |  the LEG acknowledged that |  although every programme is different |  they share a number of commonalities that differentiate them from projects. These include: an underlying strategic vision and approach to addressing adaptation objectives in a coordinated manner and utilizing resources more effectively; programmespecific institutional arrangements composed of capable steering |  management and technical supports; relevant overarching objectives |  results |  indicators and linkages between programme components that offer opportunities for synergy; and a scope wider than that of a project in terms of issues addressed |  sectors involved and/or areas included. The LEG also concluded that a well-designed programme can accommodate uncertainties |  changing circumstances and shifts in agenda. In the context of a changing climate and at a time when the LDCs are increasingly looking at ways to address medium- and long-term adaptation |  countries should take advantage of the flexibility that an effective programmatic approach offers. 25. With regard to NAPA implementation |  the LEG noted that all NAPA project activities can be designed in such a way as to form part of a programmatic or integrated approach |  since many are multisectoral |  cross-cutting and scaleable. In May 2011 |  the GEF informed of the possibility for the LDCs to develop a programmatic approach under the LDCF.8 The programmatic approach to implementing NAPAs under the LDCF is aligned with the current GEF programmatic approach under the GEF Trust Fund. This means that the LDCs that are developing programmes under the LDCF have to submit a programme proposal to the GEF by completing a Programme Framework Document (PFD) and then submit their projects under the LDCF project cycle as per common practice. In addition |  the PIFs of all the projects that compose the programme need to be submitted for review and approval by the GEF Council not later than six months after the approval of the PFD. In the light of the current procedures and to enable countries to take advantage of the potential long-term benefits that the programmatic approach can offer |  the LEG suggested that the GEF provide better fitting and more simplified procedures and guidelines for developing programmes under the LDCF. 26. The LEG also noted that the single-project approach should not be automatically discarded in favour of a programmatic approach |  in particular for NAPA implementation. |  | 8 |  |  |  | GEF. 2011.

Provision of information to the least developed countries on how to strengthen genderrelated and other considerations regarding vulnerable communities in their national adaptation programmes of action and other related adaptation plans and strategies 27. The LEG discussed the outline of the information paper on gender-related and other considerations regarding vulnerable communities in the design and implementation of activities under the LDC work programme. The constructive discussion enabled the LEG to make substantial progress in the drafting of the paper. Some of the outputs were also used for the technical paper mentioned in paragraph 14 above on the identification and implementation of medium- and long-term adaptation activities in the LDCs. 28. As preliminary outputs |  the LEG identified several ways to strengthen genderrelated and other considerations regarding vulnerable communities in NAPAs and other related adaptation plans and strategies. These included mainstreaming gender-related and other considerations through policy and planning processes |  creating a mechanism for ensuring the representation of vulnerable groups and strengthening their capacity in adaptation processes. The LEG recognized the wealth of experience that community elders people can provide with regard to community-based solutions to climate change adaptation. In order to support the above-listed initiatives |  the LEG recommended the provision of adequate capacity-building at not only the national but also the provincial and local levels |  the dissemination of lessons learned and best practices |  and the development of training modules for training government officials and community representatives. 6. Development of an information note on options for accessing additional resources under the Least Developed Countries Fund as more resources become available 29. The LEG continued its work on the identification of existing and possible future options for accessing additional resources under the LDCF |  as more funding becomes available |  for the revision and update of NAPAs |  the implementation of NAPA projects and the implementation of the other elements of the LDC work programme. 30. On the basis of exchanges at this and past meetings of the LEG | 9 and building upon the latest publication of the GEF on the LDCF | 10 the LEG continued to develop the outline and substantive content of an information paper. It will conclude this work before SBI 35. 7. Provision of support to the least developed countries for the full implementation of the least developed countries work programme 31. The LEG discussed the possible approaches to implementing the remaining elements of the LDC work programme. The group planned to develop an information paper that will provide answers to questions such as how national climate change secretariats can be established and supported in accordance with existing mandates for support under the LDCF |  and on modalities that could be developed for NAPA projects to support national data collection and analysis. The LEG intends to seek the views of the GEF and its agencies |  the NAPA teams and other relevant organizations and centres. 32. The LEG recognized that this discussion is concomitant to the discussion on accessing additional resources under the LDCF as more resources become available and |  | 9 10 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/5 |  paragraphs 31–33 and 39 |  and FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  paragraphs 15 and 16.

Available at <http://ww.thegef.org/gef/node/4433>. |  |  |  | 8 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/11 |  |  |  | decided to identify |  before SBI 35 |  the most appropriate way to package information on both matters under discussion. 8. Other issues 33. COP 17 will mark the 10-year anniversary of the adoption at COP 7 of a package of decisions to support the LDCs by recognizing their special situation as having the least capacity to deal with adverse effects of climate change. The LEG decided to contribute to celebrating the adoption of that package of decisions |  which included the establishment of the LDC work programme |  the LDCF and the LEG. To that end |  the LEG will prepare an outreach package comprising an updated brochure on the LDCs under the Convention |  the publication on best practices and lessons learned through the NAPA process |  as mentioned in paragraph 18 above |  and a special publication highlighting key milestones of the 10-year existence of the LDC work programme. 34. The LEG discussed the Istanbul Declaration on renewed and strengthened global partnership for the development of LDCs and the Programme of Action for the LDCs for the decade 2011–2020 | 11 also referred to as the Istanbul Programme of Action (IPoA). In the declaration |  governments committed to further strengthening their provision of support to the LDCs by creating a favourable environment for sustainable development |  increasing productive capacities |  diversifying economies and building the necessary infrastructure. Recalling the conclusions of the SBI at its thirty-fourth session12 in which the SBI recognized that there may be possible linkages between the IPoA and the work of the LEG |  the group agreed to further explore ways of integrating the IPoA into its work in support of the LDCs by its next meeting. 35. The LEG discussed its inputs to the expert meeting on NAPs and |  to that end |  worked to produce a shorter version of the technical paper on the identification and implementation of medium- and long-term adaptation activities (see para. 15 above). In addition |  the LEG developed three presentations:13 one on best practices and lessons learned in addressing adaptation in the LDCs through the NAPA process |  one on medium- and long-term adaptation in the LDCs and the last one on ideas for NAP guidelines |  building on the NAPA guidelines contained in the annex to decision 28/CP.7. 36. The LEG continued its work on monitoring NAPA implementation. At SBI 34 |  the group conducted another round of interviews of LDC Parties. Much interesting information was shared by countries |  which is being captured in the ongoing LEG case studies. Part of that information has been integrated into the latest publication on best practices and lessons learned through the NAPA process |  referred to in paragraph 18 above. 37. The LEG recognized the need to enhance the monitoring of the progress of NAPAs beyond the LDCF and to share relevant information with Parties. To that end |  the LEG will continue in 2012 and beyond to invite the GEF and its agencies |  relevant organizations and experts to the meetings and workshops of the LEG. Moreover |  the LEG |  by its next meeting |  will discuss in greater detail the design of a platform on best practices and lessons learned |  to be hosted by the LDC Portal |  with a view to launching the platform in the course of 2012. The platform will assist in mobilizing and engaging a wide range of organizations and institutions that are supporting or planning to support the implementation of the LDC and LEG work programmes. |  |  |  | 11 12 13 |  |  |  | United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries document A/CONF.219/3.

The LEG decided that all papers mentioned in paragraphs 15–32 above will be finalized in time for SBI 35. The technical paper on the identification and implementation of medium- and long-term adaptation activities in the LDCs |  referred to in paragraph 15 above |  is to be submitted to the SBI for its consideration. The submission is in response to the SBI noting that the process to enable LDC Parties to formulate and implement NAPs should benefit from engagement with the LEG |  including through consideration of the output of its work on medium- and long-term adaptation in LDC Parties.14 39. Concerning the other papers |  referred to in paragraph 6 above |  the LEG will continue its discussions online to define for each one of them the most appropriate delivery package for SBI 35. In any case |  the LEG intends to share the content of all the papers during SBI 35 and COP 17 at relevant special events and side events. In addition |  the LEG will package the content of all the papers and use it to develop the training materials for the regional training workshops that the LEG will conduct in 2012 for the LDCs. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Development of training materials and conduct of training workshops for the least developed countries in 2012 40. On the basis of feedback received from Parties through |  inter alia |  interviews |  surveys |  discussions at past training workshops and submissions |  and taking into consideration emerging issues |  the LEG plans to conduct regional training workshops for the LDCs in 2012 |  as indicated in its work programme for 2011–2012. 41. The regional training workshops will assist in facilitating the application of new approaches and the integration of gender-related considerations into NAPA implementation |  in strengthening human resources in support of medium- and long-term adaptation activities |  as well as in addressing key issues related to the implementation |  revision and update of NAPAs. The regional training workshops will also serve as a forum for exchanging best practices and lessons learned at the regional level |  in close collaboration with relevant agencies and regional centres. 42. The LEG decided to finalize the training materials at its next meeting. |  |  |  | E. |  |  |  | Presentation by a member of the climate change team of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic on a case study of the country |  | 43. The LEG identified in its work programme the use of LDC case studies as one of the tools to carry out its activities and enhance its provision of support to the LDCs. As such |  the LEG selected the Lao People’s Democratic Republic as one of the first two countries |  alongside Malawi |  to conduct such a case study. In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic |  the objective of the project was to inform the work of the LEG on designing and implementing medium- and long-term adaptation activities in the LDCs |  taking into account processes related to the integration of climate change adaptation issues into national development planning |  including sector-wide programmatic approaches. The case study was conducted in collaboration with the Department of Environment of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the country. |  |  |  | 14 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/7 |  paragraph 95. |  |  |  | 10 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/11 |  |  |  | 44. A member of the climate change team of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic presented to the LEG the first results of the case study |  highlighting the current situation in terms of climate and the socio-economic context and scenarios for the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and the Lower Mekong region |  as well as relevant national policies and frameworks. The case study provided an overview of the current programmes and initiatives relating to climate change at the national and regional levels and highlighted how they could form a basis for medium- and long-term adaptation. In addition |  it provided additional ideas to be considered by the country in order to start the medium- and long-term adaptation process |  including a need for enhanced capacity |  financial and technological resources |  and cooperation at the regional and international levels. 45. The LEG will continue to monitor closely the progress made by the climate change team of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic on its case study and provide support. The LEG and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic will package and share with Parties the full results of the case study as soon as they are available. |  |  |  | III. Priority activities of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for implementation in 2012 |  | 46. The LEG prioritized its work and decided to focus on the following activities with outputs in 2012: (a) Compile and analyse information on the implementation of NAPAs |  and profile and track the status of NAPA implementation for each LDC; (b) Design and conduct regional training workshops (see paras. 40–42 above); |  |  |  | (c) Prepare a technical paper on the role and application of technology in the implementation of NAPAs in the LDCs; (d) Enhance the LDC Portal |  in order for it to serve as the main knowledge base for information on the work of the LEG and the NAPA projects and their implementation |  and use it as a platform for mobilizing and engaging a wide range of organizations and institutions in supporting the implementation of the LDC and LEG work programmes; (e) Design and implement a platform on best practices and lessons learned on the LDC Portal |  in order to share information on the development and implementation of NAPAs and NAPs |  common vulnerabilities in the LDCs and practical solutions on different scales |  the role and application of technology in NAPAs |  and approaches to promote synergy (regional |  between sectors and between multilateral environmental agreements); (f) Develop updated guidelines on the preparation |  revision and update of NAPAs |  taking into account identified best practices and lessons learned |  the possible application of sector-specific and programmatic approaches |  and issues in relation to medium- and long-term adaptation; (g) Prepare papers on approaches to implementing the remaining elements of the LDC work programme |  such as on how national climate change secretariats can be established and/or strengthened and supported in the LDCs in accordance with existing mandates for support under the LDCF; and on modalities for NAPA projects to support national data collection and analysis |  as part of the dialogue with the GEF and its agencies |  the NAPA teams and other relevant organizations and centres; (h) Initiate the development of an approach to monitoring the effectiveness of adaptation efforts in the LDCs to reduce their vulnerability to climate change; |  |  |  | 11 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/11 |  |  |  | (i) Continue the dialogue with the LDC NAPA teams (and other relevant stakeholders) on NAPAs and the use of their results |  in order to inform the provision of further support by the LEG |  including support for the NAPA preparation processes of those LDCs yet to submit a NAPA |  and provide |  directly |  immediate advice on emerging issues as required |  in collaboration with the GEF and its agencies; (j) Continue to invite the GEF and its agencies and relevant organizations and experts to the meetings and workshops of the LEG |  in order to facilitate the provision of support to the LDCs |  and communicate complementary key information to the LDCs |  through regular notes |  in response to key concerns (such as accessing funds |  co-financing |  adaptation additionality and the elaboration of log frames for common project activities). 47. At its next meeting |  the LEG will develop another two-year rolling programme of work |  building on its ongoing efforts to fulfil its mandate. |  |  |  | 12 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/11 |  |  |  | Annex I |  | Status of implementation of national adaptation programmes of action and involvement of the least developed countries in the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience and the Africa Adaptation Programme |  | Country NAPA implementation Project proposal submitted Full project document submitted Involved in PPCR Involved in AAP |  |  |  | Afghanistan Angola Bangladesh Benin Bhutan Burkina Faso Burundi Cambodia Central African Republic Chad Comoros Democratic Republic of the Congo Djibouti Eritrea Ethiopia Gambia Guinea Guinea-Bissau Haiti Kiribati Lao People’s Democratic Republic Lesotho Liberia Madagascar |  |  |  | √ √ √ √ √ √ √√ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ |  |  |  | √ √ √ √ √ √ √√ √ √√ |  |  |  | √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ |  |  |  | √ √√ |  |  |  | √ √ |  |  |  | √ |  |  |  | 13 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/11 |  |  |  | Country |  |  |  | NAPA implementation Project proposal submitted Full project document submitted |  |  |  | Involved in PPCR |  |  |  | Involved in AAP |  |  |  | Malawi Mali Mauritania Mozambique Myanmar Nepal Niger Rwanda Samoa Sao Tome and Principe Senegal Sierra Leone Solomon Islands Sudan Timor-Leste Togo Tuvalu Uganda |  |  |  | √ √√ √ √ √√ √ √ √√ √√ √ √ √ √ √ √ √ |  |  |  | √ √√ √ √ √ √ √ √√ √ √ |  |  |  | √ |  |  |  | √ |  |  |  | √ √ √ √ |  |  |  | √ √ |  |  |  | √ √ |  |  |  | United Republic √ of Tanzania Vanuatu Yemen Zambia √ √ √ √ √ √ |  |  |  | Note: Under NAPA implementation |  each tick mark represents one Project Identification Form (PIF) or project proposal submitted.

In response to decision 8/CP.13 |  the LEG developed |  at its thirteenth meeting |  a work programme for 2008–2010 | 1 which was considered by the SBI at its twenty-eighth session. The SBI invited the LEG to report on its progress at the twenty-ninth session of the SBI |  and to include in this report information showing how the LEG has prioritized its work and the timelines for activities.2 |  |  |  | II. Summary of the fourteenth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | A. Proceedings 3. The fourteenth meeting of the LEG was hosted by the Government of Ethiopia and held in Addis Ababa from 29 September to 1 October 2008. The LEG elected Mr. Fred Machulu Onduri (Uganda) to the position of Chair of the group |  to replace Mr. Bubu Jallow (Gambia) |  who resigned from the LEG in September 2008. 4. By its decision 8/CP.13 |  the COP decided that the LEG may invite the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its agencies to its meetings. Furthermore |  the SBI |  at its twenty-eighth session | 3 encouraged the LEG to seek to ensure the complementarity of its work programme activities with related efforts by the GEF |  its agencies and other relevant entities. To this end |  representatives of the GEF and two of its agencies – the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) – participated in the fourteenth meeting. 5. During the meeting |  the LEG focused its work on the following: reviewing the status of NAPA preparation and implementation (see chapter II B below); considering efforts to support least developed countries (LDCs) in preparing and implementing NAPAs (chapter II C); developing further steps in the implementation of its work programme (chapter III); and prioritizing its work (annex I). It also held an interactive session with Ethiopia’s NAPA team (chapter I D). B. Status of preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 6. On the status of preparation of NAPAs |  the GEF representative reported that as at 29 September 2008 |  48 LDCs had received funding to prepare NAPAs. Of these |  38 have completed and submitted their NAPAs to the UNFCCC secretariat. Of the remaining countries |  many are expected to submit their NAPAs within the next 12 months. A few countries are still in the early stages of NAPA preparation |  including countries that have recently emerged from conflict or that face particular difficulties because of language constraints. The LEG noted the need for greater efforts to assist the 10 remaining LDC Parties in completing their NAPAs |  building on lessons learned from other Parties that have submitted their NAPAs. The LEG agreed to work with the GEF and its agencies to further examine causes of delays in the NAPA process for some LDCs |  and find solutions as appropriate. |  | 1 2 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/6 |  annex I. FCCC/SBI/2008/8 |  paragraph 50. 3 FCCC/SBI/2008/8 |  paragraph 47. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/14 Page 4 7. On the status of implementation of NAPAs |  the GEF reported on NAPA projects under consideration by the GEF.4 As at 29 September 2008 |  one project |  in Bhutan |  had received endorsement of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the GEF |  while 15 project identification forms (PIFs) had been approved by the CEO and the GEF Council (from Bangladesh |  Burkina Faso |  Cambodia |  Cape Verde |  Djibouti |  Eritrea |  Gambia |  Haiti |  Malawi |  Mauritania |  Niger |  Samoa |  Sudan |  Tuvalu and Zambia). Three PIFs had been cleared by the CEO and posted on the GEF website for Council approval (for Benin |  Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone). Four PIFs had been submitted but not yet cleared by the CEO (from Burundi |  Guinea |  Mali and Vanuatu). Two PIFs (from Yemen) are expected to be processed once the country’s NAPA has been finalized and submitted. 8. Of the countries that are eligible for funding (i.e. those that have submitted NAPAs) |  15 had yet to submit their first PIF (Central African Republic |  Comoros |  Ethiopia |  Guinea-Bissau |  Kiribati |  Lesotho |  Liberia |  Madagascar |  Maldives |  Mozambique |  Rwanda |  Sao Tome and Principe |  Senegal |  Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania). 9. To date five of the 10 GEF agencies are supporting LDCs in implementing NAPAs |  as follows: UNDP (involved in the implementation of 16 PIFs) |  UNEP (3) |  the African Development Bank (AfDB) (1) |  the International Fund for Agricultural Development (1) |  the World Bank (1) and AfDB and UNDP jointly (1). 10. In terms of distribution of funds committed under the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) |  the GEF reported that 60 per cent of those funds are being used to support projects in Africa |  32 per cent in Asia and 8 per cent in the Pacific. By sector |  46 per cent of the funding is for projects in agriculture and food security |  33 per cent in water management |  13 per cent in disaster management and 8 per cent in coastal management. C. Consideration of efforts to facilitate implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 1. Results of a survey conducted during the twenty-eighth session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation 11. During the twenty-eighth session of the SBI |  the LEG distributed a questionnaire among LDC Parties on the status of preparation and implementation of NAPAs |  in accordance with its work programme. Although only 13 responses were received |  they provide useful input to the work of the LEG in its consideration of how to facilitate implementation. The results were discussed on the first day of the meeting |  and are summarized below: Specific challenges faced: (a) A lack of human capacity at the national level for project development and implementation |  which presents a key obstacle to effective implementation of NAPA projects (and adaptation projects in general); The low capacity of national institutions in some Parties to support NAPA preparation and implementation |  and the need for more coordination between ministries; Extreme difficulties and delays faced by some LDCs in starting their NAPA preparation |  and in implementation; |  |  |  | (b) (c) |  |  |  | 4 |  |  |  | See paragraphs 13–18 of this document for a detailed explanation of the project approval and funding cycle under the GEF. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/14 Page 5 (d) Some Parties observed that |  in the case of GEF funds |  there is a long delay between the concept stage of projects and accessing the funds for implementation on the ground. Given the urgency and immediacy of NAPAs there is a need to address this delay; Long delays |  mentioned by many respondents |  in delivery of funds for project implementation after formal GEF approval at the various stages (PIF and project preparation grant (PPG)) has been received; For LDC Parties that had already completed their NAPAs |  the introduction of the PIF to replace the PDF-A proposal form in the GEF project cycle extended the project preparation cycle owing to the need to re-formulate project proposals (including for previously approved projects); Guidance for the preparation of NAPAs reflecting the new information requirements involved in completing a PIF would have been helpful to LDCs; Other issues raised by the LDC Parties on the GEF project cycle for the LDCF that still need to be addressed include: (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) (vi) (vii) (viii) (ix) The degree of efficiency in the processing of projects under the LDCF compared with those under other GEF funds; Practicalities of choosing or changing implementing agency; The number of projects a Party can submit to the LDCF for funding; The relevance of sources of co-financing |  including from non-project sources such as national budget support in a specific sector; The nature and scope of additional assessment work required before NAPA projects can be implemented; Clarification on access to GEF funds to support adaptation and NAPA implementation; How GEF agencies can best involve national sectoral institutions in the implementation of projects; Coordination of budgeting and implementation of projects funded by the LDCF with those funded by other GEF funds; How a Party’s access to the LDCF for NAPA implementation will be affected if it is no longer classified as an LDC. |  |  |  | (e) |  |  |  | (f) |  |  |  | (g) (h) |  |  |  | The following needs were expressed: (i) (j) To be better informed about implementation of NAPAs in other LDCs; Advice on finalizing NAPAs |  especially on presenting information that would facilitate the development of project proposals for funding |  and on designing effective implementation strategies that draw on financing beyond the resources available through the LDCF; Advice on how to revise priorities over time as vulnerabilities change and priority needs are addressed; |  |  |  | (k) |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/14 Page 6 (l) Assistance from the LEG in developing outreach materials that can be used at the national level to promote awareness of climate change and to support implementation of NAPAs; |  |  |  | The following proposals to respond to Parties’ needs were made: (m) (n) (o) More technical support |  including training by the LEG and others in a position to do so |  on project proposal development (e.g. development of templates for projects); Regional workshops for countries to share lessons and experiences on how to implement projects with similar objectives at the sub-regional and regional levels; Updating priorities in NAPAs and officially communicating these to the secretariat in order for the information in submitted NAPAs to be updated; |  |  |  | The following lessons were identified: (p) (q) LDC Parties should be encouraged to budget for the development of project proposals and preparation of an implementation strategy for the NAPAs; LDC Parties sometimes develop project proposals for funding that address multiple priorities in a NAPA. However |  this appears to complicate the GEF project approval process if the projects are not explicitly linked to the stated list of priorities in the NAPA; Co-financing does not appear to be an obstacle to the implementation of NAPAs for some LDC Parties; Establishing a good working relationship with the GEF agency at the national level is very important for effective project development and implementation; LDC Parties may be able to use the information collected during the preparation of their NAPAs when conducting the vulnerability and adaptation assessment required as part of their second national communications; The NAPA process is an important foundation for LDCs to develop national climate change adaptation strategies for the medium to long term. |  |  |  | (r) (s) (t) |  |  |  | (u) |  |  |  | 12. The LEG |  in an attempt to expand the number of responses to the survey |  decided to encourage those LDCs that had not completed the questionnaire |  to do so. To this end |  the LEG requested the secretariat to follow up with national climate change focal points and NAPA teams to solicit more feedback. 2. Discussion with the Global Environment Facility and its agencies The Global Environment Facility project cycle 13. Representatives from the GEF and its agencies took part in the first day of the LEG meeting. In response to requests by LDC Parties to clarify the LDCF project cycle |  the representative from the GEF outlined the four stages involved: (a) Pre-PIF activities: The Party selects a project idea based on priorities identified in its NAPA |  identifies an implementing partner from among the 10 GEF agencies |  then develops a project concept into a PIF or a combined PIF/PPG submission; |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/14 Page 7 (b) PIF: A PIF |  a brief description of the project concept including indicative activities |  a budget and implementation arrangement |  is prepared and submitted to the GEF for review via the chosen agency with the sole purpose of determining whether the project will be eligible for LDCF funding; PPG: On approval of the PIF by the GEF |  a request for financial support in the form of a PPG for development of a more comprehensive project proposal is submitted for endorsement by the CEO; CEO endorsement: A comprehensive project description |  including detailed project argumentation |  description of activities |  budget and |  implementation arrangements with the purpose of demonstrating a fully developed project ready for implementation |  is submitted. |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | (d) |  |  |  | 14. The representative from the GEF explained that four elements of a proposed project are taken into account in the review of a PIF: (1) the basic project idea or the additional cost argument; (2) implementation set-up; (3) the indicative budget and co-financing; and (4) how closely the project matches NAPA priorities. 15. The following timelines are followed for the processing of PIFs under the LDCF: (a) (b) PIFs are reviewed by the GEF secretariat on a rolling basis |  within a maximum of 10 working days; If a PIF is cleared |  it is included in the GEF work programme and posted on the Web for four weeks for consideration by the GEF Council. If the elements mentioned in paragraph 14 above are not sufficiently detailed in the PIF |  the PIF is returned to the GEF agency for revision and resubmission; Once the PIF has been approved by the Council |  funds are reserved for the project |  pending submission of a fully developed project document (PPG) within 18 months |  after an endorsement by the CEO; Resubmitted PIFs are usually processed within a maximum of 10 days |  following the steps above. |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | (d) 16. |  |  |  | The PPG proposal submission stage works as follows: (a) (b) Upon clearance of the PIF by the CEO |  the project is now eligible for funding; A PPG proposal must be prepared |  clearly describing the process for developing the full project proposal that will be presented for CEO endorsement |  and including a budget and a schedule of activities to be implemented; The PPG is approved by the CEO (without the proposal being posted on the Web). A PIF and PPG proposal can be submitted together to speed up processing; |  |  |  | (c) (d) |  |  |  | 17. The final stage is CEO endorsement. LDCF projects are endorsed directly by the CEO |  and only posted for four weeks on the Web as information for the Council. Once endorsed |  funds are released to the implementing agency to start implementation. The CEO endorsement is contingent on the following: (a) A detailed description of the four elements listed issues in paragraph 14 above; |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/14 Page 8 (b) (c) Description of a monitoring and evaluation framework that includes impact indicators to measure the environmental impact of the project; Letters of endorsement for co-financing. |  |  |  | 18. In the discussion that followed |  it was observed that given the tight timelines between a project proposal and its implementation |  a solid justification of the project in the PIF and the PPG proposal |  accompanied by an accurate assessment of the baseline investment and additional investments needed to address climate change concerns |  is key to a project’s success. Activities of the Global Environment Facility agencies and lessons learned 19. The representative from UNEP described efforts in NAPA preparation and implementation for which UNEP is providing financial and technical support. She explained that Angola and Myanmar have just started preparing their NAPAs. Three LDCs have successfully submitted PIFs |  which have been approved (Djibouti |  Gambia and Mauritania) |  while the PIFs of another three are in final review (Lesotho |  Comoros and Rwanda). Two LDCs are in the design phase of their PIFs and expect to submit them to the GEF in the coming months (Cambodia and United Republic of Tanzania). 20. The representative from UNDP also shared information with the LEG on efforts to support implementation of NAPAs. UNDP has supported the preparation of 31 NAPAs and the implementation of 23 |  16 of which are either in the PPG phase (project design) or waiting for clearance by the GEF before proceeding to project design. For 12 of these 16 |  UNDP submitted the PIFs within a year as the Parties’ chosen implementing agency |  which means the projects are on track to meet the GEF allotted time frame of 22 months between the end of NAPA preparation and project implementation. 21. UNDP is seeking to build partnerships with other United Nations agencies in order to draw on their respective strengths. For example |  it hopes to work with UNEP in the Comoros and Rwanda |  and with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in Lesotho and Zambia. It was mentioned that UNDP’s strengths lie in disaster risk reduction |  national planning to achieve Millennium Development Goals and coordination of United Nations agencies at the national level. 22. The representative also described a tool kit that UNDP uses to support NAPA implementation |  which includes: project development guidelines |  the Adaptation Policy Framework5 (a monitoring and evaluation framework for adaptation) |  a web-based programming site and publications on best practices and lessons learned. 23. In promoting a country-driven approach |  UNDP is supporting efforts by several LDC Parties to coordinate adaptation planning at the national level. For example |  UNDP is supporting Malawi and Nepal in creating platforms for coordinating adaptation activities. 24. Based on the discussions between the LEG and the GEF agencies at the meeting |  major challenges in the development of NAPA projects for implementation were highlighted: (a) (b) (c) Putting forward a strong argument for the additionality of proposed project activities; Identification of the required co-financing in some cases; Complementarity between the NAPAs which take a project approach and national development efforts that are sources of co-financing and which also take a programme approach; |  |  |  | 5 |  |  |  | <http://www.undp.org/gef/adaptation/climate-change/APF.htm>. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/14 Page 9 (d) (e) Limited capacity in agencies |  regional and country offices |  as well as at the national levels |  to manage the new NAPA projects; Concluding contracts and fulfilling reporting obligations for NAPA preparation projects before implementation can start. |  |  |  | 25. The LEG and the representatives of the GEF and its agencies also discussed the issues that arose from the questionnaire referred to in paragraph 11 above. The following action points were agreed: (a) (b) (c) (d) The GEF and its agencies will explore the possibility of publishing a “Quick Guide” to accessing the LDCF |  to be disseminated to all LDCs in the near future; The LEG will work with the GEF and its agencies to further explore causes of delays and to identify solutions as appropriate; The GEF and its agencies will contribute to LEG projects such as the step-by-step guide for NAPA implementation; The LEG |  through the secretariat |  will contact the other GEF agencies that are involved in NAPA implementation but did not attend its fourteenth meeting |  and request an update on their work in NAPA implementation as well as materials that could be used in developing the two guides. |  |  |  | 26. It was observed that there is a need to improve the flow of information |  especially on problems encountered by specific countries. To facilitate more effective responses to problems |  it was agreed that information on responses to surveys showing specific difficulties on a country-by-country basis should be compiled by the LEG and shared with the GEF and its agencies regularly. This information would enable the provision of targeted technical support to LDC Parties. 27. The LEG offered to provide information to LDC Parties on issues that are relevant to project preparation and development such as on: adaptation projects in the NAPAs and their links to national development policy; costs and benefits of different adaptation options; synergy and trade-offs among adaptation activities; and synthesis of key findings from ongoing research on adaptation in the context of the UNFCCC |  to guide planning and implementation. 28. Lastly |  the LEG agreed that constraints on the preparation of NAPAs would also impact on implementation unless adequate capacity were built at the national level to address the constraints. The LEG concluded that the interaction with the GEF and its agencies during its fourteenth meeting had been fruitful |  and it looks forward to more interaction at its future meetings. 3. Additional guidance for the design and preparation of strategies to implement national adaptation programmes of action 29. The LEG noted the difficulties that many LDC Parties are having in designing effective implementation strategies for their NAPAs. The LEG also considered the questions and concerns that countries raised in completing their NAPAs. To this end |  the LEG as part of its work programme is developing a technical paper to offer additional guidance to LDCs for the NAPA preparation and design of implementation strategies. 4. Development of a step-by-step guide to implementing national adaptation programmes of action 30. To address the need of LDC Parties for more support and information when accessing funds from the LDCF and implementing NAPAs  |  the LEG has agreed on terms of reference for the preparation |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/14 Page 10 of a step-by-step guide to NAPA implementation that the group is developing. The guide will address many of the questions raised by LDCs on how to implement NAPAs effectively |  and will build on the information contained in the technical paper mentioned in paragraph 29 above. 5. Efforts to promote synergy 31. The LEG considered efforts to promote synergy among projects presented in NAPAs for implementation. It was discussed that |  when implementing NAPA projects in the forestry sector that address land degradation and promote sustainable land management (SLM) to enhance the resilience of vulnerable systems and communities |  LDCs should take steps to coordinate this work with their implementation of national action plans (NAPs) under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. The LEG decided to include a discussion of options for promoting and coordinating implementation of NAPA projects alongside NAP projects in the step-by-step guide. 32. The LEG also decided to identify synergy among projects from different NAPAs within a region or sector |  as part of its work in synthesizing and analysing NAPAs.6 Furthermore |  the LEG discussed actions that it could undertake to promote synergy |  including: (a) (b) To facilitate the sharing of information among Parties on activities being implemented to help guide others in their project development; To produce outreach materials that identify a common set of activities and tasks for the main types of project within the sectors that are most frequently addressed in NAPAs (agriculture |  water and forestry); To conduct regional workshops to promote the exchange of experiences and lessons learned in preparing and implementing NAPAs; To include information on sources of funding and funding priorities by major donors by region in the step-by-step guide to NAPA implementation; D. Interaction between the Least Developed Countries Expert Group and Ethiopia’s national adaptation programme of action team 33. In keeping with its practice of interacting with the national NAPA teams where the LEG meeting is hosted |  the LEG conducted an interactive session with representatives of Ethiopia’s NAPA team. Ethiopia’s NAPA team presented an overview of the NAPA process |  its institutional arrangements and stakeholder consultations |  and plans for implementation. The presentation focused on the main outcomes and priorities presented in the NAPA. The team mentioned the value of the NAPA preparation process in raising the profile of climate change issues in Ethiopia |  as well as the profile of the institutions handling climate change matters at the national level. 34. The team described plans of the Ethiopian Government to convene a meeting with donors to solicit funding for its priority NAPA activities. To this end |  the team requested assistance from the LEG and the secretariat in the preparations for this meeting |  which is tentatively planned to take place in December 2008. |  |  |  | (c) (d) |  |  |  | 6 |  |  |  | See the work programme in document FCCC/SBI/2008/6 |  annex I |  page 7. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/14 Page 11 |  |  |  | III. Priority activities for implementation |  | 35. The work programme of the LEG for 2008–2010 as contained in document FCCC/SBI/2008/6 |  annex I |  was considered during the meeting |  and the following activities were identified as priority for implementation: (a) (b) Efforts to support countries emerging from conflict or experiencing particular difficulties in finalizing their NAPA owing to language constraints; Updating and improving guidance for the preparation and design of NAPA implementation strategies |  taking into account issues that have been raised by Parties and GEF agencies; Efforts to build the capacity of LDC Parties to implement NAPAs through the provision of guides |  and other technical support designed to improve |  among other things |  Parties’ access to the LDCF; Efforts to provide technical support and training in areas identified by Parties during the stocktaking meeting on NAPAs held in September 2007 as well as through other channels; Improvements to NAPA-related knowledge management and outreach |  aimed at sharing good practices and lessons learned from piloting adaptation projects with other developing countries; Support for LDC Parties in integrating adaptation into national planning. |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | (d) |  |  |  | (e) |  |  |  | (f) |  |  |  | 36. In response to the request of the SBI |  the LEG considered which of its work programme activities should take priority in 2008–2010. A list of priority activities |  with timelines |  is presented in annex I. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/14 Page 12 Annex I |  |  |  | Priority activities of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  2008–2010 |  | Activity Enhance efforts to support least developed countries (LDCs) with special needs in preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) Further support NAPA preparation and implementation through preparation of a technical paper for NAPA preparation and development of implementation strategies Prepare and disseminate a step-by-step guide on NAPA implementation Organize training in the design of NAPA implementation strategies and preparation of projects based on the step-by-step guide Conduct a survey of LDC Parties |  United Nations agencies and other relevant actors to collect information on the status of implementation of NAPAs Conduct capacity-building and outreach activities as requested by Parties at the 2007 stocktaking meeting and through surveys Summarize key aspects of NAPAs with a view to identifying key vulnerabilities |  adaptation options by sector and opportunities for regional synergy |  and to show evidence of alignment with |  and integration of NAPA activities into |  national development priorities and plans Conduct activities to promote synergy during implementation |  | a |  |  |  | Main deliverable and target dates Ongoing |  |  |  | Distribute technical paper by December 2008 |  |  |  | Catalyse action by United Nations organizations and bilateral and multilateral agencies in support of NAPA implementation and implementation of the LEG work programme |  |  |  | Awareness raising of the NAPA process with a view to advancing adaptation and encouraging effective implementation of NAPAs |  |  |  | Develop an approach paper on the collection of information for assessing the effectiveness of the NAPA programme and NAPA projects at the national and global level |  | a |  |  |  | Finalize guide by the fifteenth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) (March 2009) and distribute soon afterwards • Collaborate with relevant agencies to provide ongoing training • Conduct regional training based on the guide from April 2009 onwards Ongoing follow-up with LDC Parties |  conduct next complete survey at the thirtieth session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) Training activities |  workshops and other forms of technical support |  ongoing • Distribute a brochure on NAPAs by the fourteenth session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) • Analyse results at LEG 15 and include results in LEG report to SBI 30 • Produce outreach materials as appropriate • Continue to explore synergy in implementation of projects addressing multiple objectives |  ongoing • Regional initiatives including workshops to exchange experiences |  to be scheduled • Support the Global Environment Facility and its agencies in producing a “Quick Guide” to accessing the Least Developed Countries Fund • Participate in joint training activities and knowledge exchange initiatives • Expand the LDC website to include a portal with NAPA projects • Produce a publication on the NAPA approach by LEG 16 • Hold as side event at COP 14 for launch of NAPAs • Produce outreach materials for NAPA teams • Participate in collaborative efforts and initiatives by partner organizations Finalize working paper at LEG 16 |  |  |  | Summarized from document FCCC/SBI/2008/6 |  annex I. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/14 Page 13 Annex II |  |  |  | Members of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group as at 29 September 2008 |  | Mr. Mirza Shawkat Ali Mr. Ibila Djibril Mr. Adérito Manuel Fernandes Santana Mr. Benjamin Karmorh Mr. Erwin Künzi Ms. Beth Lavender Mr. Fred Machulu Onduri Mr. Russell Nari Mr. Mohamed Shareef Mr. Batu Krishna Uprety Mr. Adrianus Jan Verhagen Vacant1 Bangladesh Benin Sao Tome and Principe Liberia Austria Canada Uganda Vanuatu Maldives Nepal The Netherlands – |  |  |  | ----- |  |  |  | 1 |  |  |  | This position should be filled by an expert from a Party not included in Annex I of the Convention. |  |  |  |

Introduction |  | A. Mandate 1. The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by its decision 29/CP.7 |  established the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) to advise on the preparation and implementation strategy for national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) |  and adopted the terms of reference of the LEG. According to these terms of reference |  the LEG is to convene twice each year |  and report on its work to the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) at its subsequent sessions. By its decision 7/CP.9 |  the COP decided to extend the mandate of the LEG under its original terms of reference and to review the progress |  need for continuation and terms of reference of the group at its eleventh session. 2. The work programme for the second term of the LEG (2004–2005) was developed at the fifth meeting of the group |  and was endorsed by the SBI at its twentieth session. By its decision 4/CP.10 |  the COP requested the LEG to prepare possible elements to be considered on the role of the group in support of the implementation of NAPAs as a new mandate and to report thereon to the SBI at its twenty-third session. The LEG was also requested |  in consultation with least developed country Parties |  to include in its report to the twenty-third session of the SBI information on the potential technical and financial difficulties that least developed country (LDC) Parties may have in the implementation of NAPAs. B. Scope of the note 3. This document summarizes the work of the LEG during its current two-year term |  and reports on intersessional work and the four meetings of the LEG in 2004 and 2005 |  with special emphasis on the results of the eighth meeting of the LEG |  held at Tarawa |  Kiribati |  from 17 to 20 August 2005. 4. Detailed coverage of the first three meetings of the LEG during the current biennium is included in documents FCCC/SBI/2004/3 |  FCCC/SBI/2004/17 and FCCC/SBI/2005/12. |  |  |  | II. Operational issues |  | 5. The Government of Mozambique hosted the fifth meeting of the LEG (the first meeting in the current biennium) in Maputo |  from 22 to 24 March 2004. The Government of the Gambia hosted the sixth meeting in Banjul from 24 to 25 September 2004. The seventh meeting was held in Bonn |  Germany |  from 4 to 7 April 2005. And the eighth meeting was hosted by the Government of Kiribati in Tarawa from 17 to 20 August 2005. The governments of Canada |  Ireland |  New Zealand and Sweden provided financial support for the work of the LEG during the biennium 2004–2005. 6. In accordance with paragraph 5 of the LEG terms of reference |  the LEG is to elect annually a Chair |  a Vice-Chair and two rapporteurs from among its LDC members. At its fifth meeting the group elected Mr. Laavasa Malua (Samoa) as its Chair |  Mr. Fred Onduri (Uganda) as Vice-Chair |  Ms. Madeleine Diouf (Senegal) as francophone rapporteur |  and Mr. Puroshottam Kunwar (Nepal) as anglophone rapporteur. At its seventh meeting |  the group elected Mr. Paul Desanker (Malawi) as Chair |  Ms Madeleine Diouf (Senegal) as Vice-Chair and francophone rapporteur and Mr. Puroshottam Kunwar (Nepal) as anglophone rapporteur. Due to the language barriers that African Portuguese-speaking LDCs are facing in preparing their NAPAs |  the LEG agreed to establish a new post of lusophone rapporteur |  to which Mr. Almeida Sitoe (Mozambique) was elected. 7. In accordance with paragraph 11 of the terms of reference |  the secretariat supported the implementation of LEG activities and facilitated the preparation of the group’s reports for consideration by the SBI. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/20 Page 4 |  |  |  | III. Contributions of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group to the national adaptation programme of action process |  | 8. The main objective of the LEG is to advise on the preparation and implementation strategy for NAPAs. In its second term |  the LEG continued to provide guidance and advice on the preparation of NAPAs |  focusing in particular on the elements which were identified during the previous term to require more work |  and initiated the consideration of guidance on the implementation strategy of NAPAs in line with the mandate given by the terms of reference of the LEG. 9. During its second term |  the LEG has delivered various products and conducted various activities to this end |  including technical papers on a number of issues |  surveys on the NAPA process and reviews of draft NAPAs at the request of LDC Parties. The LEG also provided input to a number of workshops and meetings |  including the informal consultations on the LDC Fund |  which took place in Bonn |  Germany |  on 13 and 14 May 2005 |  prior to the twenty-second sessions of the subsidiary bodies. These consultations were seen as a positive step in facilitating the subsequent agreement on further guidance to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) on how to operationalize the LDC Fund. A. Advice on capacity-building needs 10. The terms of reference of the LEG mandate the LEG to advise on capacity-building needs for the preparation and implementation of NAPAs and to provide recommendations thereon. During its previous term (2002–2003) |  the LEG supported capacity-building for the preparation of NAPAs through a global workshop and subsequent regional training workshops. During its current term |  the group |  in cooperation with the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) |  prepared a document titled “Selection of examples and exercises drawn from regional NAPA workshops” |  which includes a synthesis of the training material that was provided during the four LEG regional NAPA workshops held during 2003. This publication has been widely disseminated in French and English to the NAPA teams in LDCs. 11. The LEG also acted upon the needs expressed by LDC Parties during the 2003 regional workshops |  in particular those needs relating to the two NAPA steps of ranking/prioritization and synthesis of available information on the adverse effects of climate change. The group recognized that countries would benefit from having access to a list of experts on ranking and prioritization as well as other steps in the NAPA process in each region. It subsequently identified such experts and disseminated this information to the LDCs through the UNFCCC LDC web page <http://unfccc.int/ldc>. 12. In order to assist LDCs in completing the second step of the NAPA process (synthesis of available information) |  the LEG prepared a technical paper on synthesis of available information on the adverse effects of climate change (FCCC/TP/2005/2). Another LEG publication |  the “NAPA primer” <http://unfccc.int/ldc> |  provides background information on the concept of NAPAs |  in particular within the broader framework of adaptation |  as well as examples of simulated NAPAs in order to illustrate the application of the different NAPA steps leading to the identification of project profiles for the urgent and immediate adaptation needs of an LDC. 13. During its current term |  the group considered the barriers that African Portuguese-speaking LDCs face in preparing their NAPAs and developed an action plan to support Portuguese-speaking countries that are lagging behind in the preparation of their NAPAs. The action plan includes the translation of technical documents |  a training workshop in one of the lusophone LDC Parties |  and the development of a list of Portuguese-speaking experts on adaptation to climate change who have knowledge relevant to the NAPA process |  and who can be made available to assist lusophone LDC Parties. The UNFCCC secretariat also arranged for the translation of the LEG annotated guidelines for the preparation of NAPAs into Portuguese. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/20 Page 5 14. The LEG is cooperating with UNITAR on the development of an internet-based platform to support LDC Parties in the preparation of their NAPAs. This initiative responds to the LEG mandate to provide technical assistance to LDC Parties |  upon request |  for their NAPA preparation |  and is conducted in cooperation with the GEF implementing agencies and bilateral donors. The platform |  available both in French and English | 1 allows for experience sharing among country teams and provides the opportunity for online dialogue between all actors involved in the NAPA process. It also includes a web page where key NAPA information is available to the public. B. Promotion of synergy 15. The terms of reference of the LEG include a provision on facilitating the exchange of information and on promoting regional synergy |  and synergy with other multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) |  in the preparation and implementation strategy of NAPAs. 16. Building upon an earlier paper on synergy with other MEAs |  which was included as an appendix to the LEG annotations to the NAPA guidelines |  the LEG developed a technical paper (FCCC/TP/2005/3) synthesizing information on synergy among MEAs as included in NAPA proposals |  national action programmes of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification |  national biodiversity strategies and action plans under the Convention on Biological Diversity |  and poverty reduction strategy papers |  as well as in efforts by the GEF and its implementing agencies to promote synergy. The paper also examines barriers to synergy among MEAs within the NAPA process |  and possible action by the LEG to promote synergy in accordance with the COP mandate within the LEG terms of reference. 17. The LEG also prepared a technical paper on regional synergy in the context of the NAPA process (FCCC/TP/2005/4). The group agreed to explore synergy with existing regional networks and to revisit the promotion of regional synergy during the NAPA implementation phase once a sufficient number of NAPAs have been finalized. C. Database on local coping strategies 18. Acknowledging the value of traditional knowledge |  the LEG developed a database of local coping strategies.2 The database can help countries identify different time-tested adaptation options applied in other countries |  and can also serve as an important input into the identification of opportunities for regional synergy during NAPA implementation. D. Implementation strategy 19. The terms of reference of the LEG include several provisions relating to supporting the implementation strategy of NAPAs (paragraph 9 (a) to (d)). In this context the group developed a technical paper (FCCC/TP/2005/5) covering aspects relating to further prioritization of adaptation activities |  securing financial resources |  institutional arrangements |  monitoring and evaluation and regional synergy. 20. The LEG also initiated efforts towards setting the benchmarks for the NAPA process and adaptation action |  with the objective of identifying good practices in the NAPA process |  as well as in the selection and implementation of adaptation projects which could be of use to LDCs in the NAPA implementation phase. |  |  |  | 1 2 |  |  |  | Available at <www.cern.ch/napa>. The database is accessible from the secretariat web site <www.unfccc.int/ldc>. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/20 Page 6 E. Review of draft national adaptation programmes of action 21. The LEG initiated a review process of draft NAPA documents |  upon request by LDC Parties. To date the LEG has reviewed the draft NAPAs of Bhutan |  Cambodia |  Malawi and Samoa |  with the aim of providing comments and suggestions for further improvement |  especially on the prioritization and ranking aspects of the NAPA process. F. Outreach 22. The LEG organized a side event at the tenth session of the COP in which a number of presentations were given by LDC Parties at different stages of NAPA preparation |  to update participants on the status of preparation of NAPAs and on LEG support thereon. A LEG side event is also planned for the eleventh session of the COP |  covering the work of the LEG since its inception |  including on different aspects of NAPA preparation and implementation. 23. The LEG was represented at a number of workshops and meetings throughout the biennium |  in which awareness was enhanced on the work of the LEG and on the support and elaboration it has been providing to Parties on the use of the NAPA methodology. 24. In conjunction with its regular meetings |  the LEG has conducted interactive sessions with national NAPA teams of host countries. During the current biennium this has taken place with the teams of Gambia |  Kiribati and Mozambique. Prior to its eighth meeting |  the LEG also provided technical guidance and advice to NAPA teams from Pacific LDCs that were represented at the subregional workshop on NAPA preparation in Tarawa |  Kiribati. |  |  |  | IV. Cooperation with other groups under the Convention process |  | 25. As a follow-up to the provisions of paragraph 2 (a) of decision 10/CP.8 |  meetings among the chairs of the three expert groups have been held regularly during the sessions of the subsidiary bodies |  under the guidance of the chairs of the subsidiary bodies. 26. In response to a request by the Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) at that body’s twenty-first session |  the LEG reported at the subsequent session on possible areas for future collaboration with other expert groups |  including on issues relating to capacitybuilding |  technical advice |  synergy and adaptation (see FCCC/SB/2005/12 para. 17). 27. At the meeting between the chairs of the subsidiary bodies and the chairs of the three expert groups held on the margins of the twenty-second sessions of the subsidiary bodies |  the three expert group chairs agreed to explore the possibility of organizing a joint meeting in 2006 on adaptation to climate change |  which seems to be the main common ground for collaboration among the groups |  including vulnerability assessments under the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (CGE) |  adaptation technologies under the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) and the NAPA process under the LEG. At its eighth meeting |  the LEG identified the following topics as possible areas for discussion should such a joint workshop take place: (a) (b) (c) (d) Local coping strategies Integrating work on NAPAs into second national communications Benchmarking of adaptation Adaptation technologies |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/20 Page 7 (e) (f) (g) Methodological work Capacity-building needs during NAPA implementation Funding constraints faced by LDCs. |  |  |  | 28. In the context of cooperation among expert groups |  the LEG was represented at the following two workshops organized by the other expert groups under the UNFCCC: the hands-on training workshop on vulnerability and adaptation for the Africa region |  held in Maputo |  Mozambique |  from 18 to 22 April 2005 by the CGE |  where participating LEG members provided input into possible links between the NAPA process and that of preparation of national communications; and the seminar on the development and transfer of environmentally sound technologies for adaptation to climate change |  held in Trinidad |  Trinidad and Tobago |  from 14 to 16 June 2005 by the EGTT |  during which the LEG presented the work of the group on endogenous coping strategies and technologies |  and provided examples of adaptation-technology needs identified in draft NAPAs. |  |  |  | V. Feedback from the least developed countries on the national adaptation programme of action process and on support from the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | 29. At the beginning of its second term |  the LEG agreed to seek feedback from the LDCs on their NAPA preparation process |  particularly in order to identify any difficulties encountered in the use of the NAPA guidelines and to direct LEG efforts towards meeting their needs thereon. Under an initiative by the coordinator of the group of least developed countries |  a first questionnaire on the NAPA preparation process was circulated at the twentieth sessions of the subsidiary bodies among representatives of the LDCs. Responses revealed that the problems encountered by countries in preparing their NAPAs were mostly logistical |  in particular relating to the timely provision of funding. Respondents identified the following main areas where capacities could be enhanced to improve the NAPA preparation process: technical training |  funding |  vulnerability assessment |  information exchange |  information technology equipment |  criteria development for ranking and prioritization of projects |  and project formulation. 30. A follow-up questionnaire was administered to LDC delegates on the margins of the twenty-first sessions of the subsidiary bodies and the tenth session of the COP. Responses revealed the positive progress made so far by all actors involved in the NAPA process |  which can be seen in the fact that most LDC Parties are engaging in more advanced steps of the NAPA process. One country had already submitted its NAPA. 31. Responding to a mandate from decision 4/CP.10 |  the LEG conducted a survey during the twenty-second sessions of the subsidiary bodies mainly focused on issues relating to the upcoming implementation phase of NAPAs. The results of this survey are addressed in the following chapter. |  |  |  | VI. Potential technical and financial difficulties faced by least developed country Parties in implementing their national adaptation programmes of action |  | 32. Decision 4/CP.10 |  paragraph 2 |  requested the LEG |  in consultation with LDC Parties |  to include in its report to the SBI at its twenty-third session information on the potential technical and financial difficulties that LDC Parties may have in the implementation of NAPAs. In response |  the group |  supported by the secretariat |  developed and conducted a survey among LDC focal points at the twenty-second sessions of the subsidiary bodies |  inquiring about their expected technical and financial difficulties with regards to implementation. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/20 Page 8 A. Technical difficulties 33. LDC Parties and the LEG identified the following areas as posing potential technical difficulties for NAPA implementation: (a) Data availability: (i) (ii) (iii) (b) Lack of adequate |  reliable and consistent environmental and socioeconomic data Scattered |  limited |  discontinued and insufficient data Institutional constraints in accessing and sharing data |  |  |  | Institutional and human capacity (i) Institutional capacity |  including limitations in: − − − − (ii) Accessibility of project sites due to climatic |  geographic and infrastructural conditions (inappropriate vehicles |  bad roads |  etc.); Socio-economic data and technical tools (e.g. access to and execution of biophysical and socio-economic models); Capacity of institutions holding and managing databases; Scientific |  technical and institutional capacity to implement projects. |  |  |  | Human capacity |  including the need for: − − Support to the entity entrusted with the coordination and monitoring of the implementation of NAPAs; Technical capacity-building to transform NAPA project profiles into detailed projects |  including development of implementation strategies and plans; Support for the engagement of international and local experts for the implementation of NAPAs; Adequate understanding of climate change issues and sufficient expertise at the national level for the implementation of adaptation measures |  including NAPA activities. B. Financial difficulties |  |  |  | − − |  |  |  | 34. LDC Parties and the LEG identified the following areas as posing potential financial difficulties for NAPA implementation: (a) Ensuring equity |  such that neither the first nor the last LDC Parties to finish their NAPAs is penalized. In addition |  special consideration should be given to LDC Parties that have recently evolved from conflict situations Uncertainties regarding: (i) (ii) The level and availability of funds to cover all NAPA projects; The range of funding sources; |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/20 Page 9 (iii) (iv) The possibility of access to other funds for NAPA projects (eg. the Special Climate Change Fund and the Strategic Priority on Adaptation); Whether the timing of the disbursement of funds would cause distortions in the national planning cycle |  undermining credibility of future environmental projects. |  |  |  | (c) (d) |  |  |  | Funding modalities |  including opportunities for securing co-financing and determining the adaptation component of each NAPA project Measuring urgency |  e.g. potential increase in costs |  including in terms of human impact and loss of life |  and in terms of irreversible changes and damage if a reduction in key vulnerabilities is not addressed immediately Capacity to identify potential funding sources Mismatch between national planning cycles and donor fiscal cycles in the implementation of NAPAs |  which slows implementation Inability to accurately budget for NAPA activities due to potential price fluctuations Budgeting for multisectoral NAPA activities Funding of national climate change focal points to ensure effective coordination and monitoring for the implementation of NAPA projects. C. Other constraints |  |  |  | (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) |  |  |  | 35. LDC Parties identified a number of additional factors that are relevant to the effective coordination of NAPA implementation across sectors and institutions |  including: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) Institutional and legal frameworks Political situation in the country Institutional arrangements for those adaptation activities involving many stakeholders Level of synergy between the projects and state structures Commitment of implementing agencies Commitment of stakeholders Organizational capacity to provide benefits to targeted population Implementing capacity at the community level Cultural factors. |  |  |  | VII. Possible elements of a new mandate for the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | 36. Pursuant to the mandate included in decision 4/CP.10 |  paragraph 1 |  the group considered possible elements on the role of the LEG in supporting NAPA implementation. Based on inputs from LDC Parties |  the experience gained throughout its current two-year mandate |  and the fact that the |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2005/20 Page 10 majority of LDC Parties are still preparing their NAPAs |  the LEG identified the following possible elements for its future mandate for consideration by the SBI: (a) To provide technical guidance and advice on the implementation of NAPAs |  including the identification of possible sources of data |  and the formulation of detailed NAPA project proposals To serve in an advisory capacity to the LDCs |  for the preparation and implementation of NAPAs through |  inter alia |  workshops |  individual assistance to LDC Parties and review of draft NAPAs |  upon request by LDC Parties To advise on capacity-building needs for the preparation and implementation of NAPAs and to provide recommendations |  as appropriate |  taking into account relevant capacitybuilding initiatives To facilitate the exchange of information among LDC Parties |  e.g. on good practices that are relevant to NAPA implementation To promote regional synergy |  and synergy with other multilateral environmental conventions in the preparation and implementation of NAPAs To advise on the mainstreaming of NAPAs into regular development planning in the context of national strategies for sustainable development To serve in an advisory capacity to LDC Parties on different funding options |  including funds under the GEF and other multilateral and bilateral sources To advise on |  and facilitate |  the effective participation of LDC Parties in different aspects of the Convention and its instruments. |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) |  |  |  | ----- |  |  |  |

Mandate |  | 1. The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by its decision 29/CP.7 |  established the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) to advise on the preparation and implementation strategy for national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) |  and adopted its terms of reference. According to these terms of reference |  the LEG is to convene its meeting twice each year |  and report on its work to the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI). 2. By its decision 4/CP.11 |  the COP decided to extend the mandate of the LEG under its original terms of reference and to review |  at its thirteenth session |  the progress |  need for continuation and terms of reference of the group |  and to adopt a decision thereon. At its ninth meeting |  the LEG developed a work programme for 2006−2007 | 1 which was considered by the SBI at its twenty-fourth session. The LEG was requested to keep the SBI informed of its efforts to implement the work programme over the biennium 2006−2007 |  in accordance with its mandate |  by including in its subsequent reports information on expected outcomes. 3. The SBI |  at its twenty-fifth session |  expressed its appreciation to the LEG for its good work in implementing its work programme; encouraged it to seek to ensure the complementarity of its activities with related efforts by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its implementing agencies; requested it to convene a meeting |  with the assistance of the secretariat and subject to the availability of resources |  to take stock of the progress made by Parties in NAPA preparation and implementation; and to consult |  through the secretariat |  on input for this meeting from the secretariat of the GEF and its implementing agencies |  and to report on the outcomes of the meeting to the SBI at its twenty-seventh session.2 |  |  |  | II. Summary of the eleventh meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | 4. The eleventh meeting of the LEG was hosted by the Government of Solomon Islands and held in Honiara |  Solomon Islands |  from 26 to 28 March 2007. The Governments of Belgium |  Canada |  Ireland |  New Zealand and Norway provided financial support for the meeting. 5. The LEG continued its efforts to implement its work programme in accordance with its mandate. Its eleventh meeting focused on reviewing the NAPA preparation and implementation process; considered efforts that support Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the preparation of NAPAs; elaborated on further activities in support of the implementation of its work programme; interacted with representatives of the NAPA teams of the Maldives |  Solomon Islands |  Tuvalu and Vanuatu; and planned its stocktaking meeting. A. Review of the preparation of national adaptation programmes of action 1. Status of preparation 6. The information available to the LEG indicated that 44 NAPA proposals have been approved for funding by the GEF. Of these |  14 have been completed and submitted to the UNFCCC secretariat as at 31 March 2007. The list of submitted NAPAS is available on the UNFCCC website at: <http://unfccc.int/adaptation/napas/items/2679.php>. |  |  |  | 1 2 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2006/9 |  annex I. FCCC/SBI/2006/28 |  paragraphs 81–86. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/12 Page 4 7. Since September 2006 |  five of the LDC Parties in the process of preparing their NAPAs have submitted draft NAPAs |  one of which was in Portuguese |  to the LEG for comments |  in accordance with decision 29/CP.7 |  annex |  paragraph 9. It was noted during the eleventh LEG meeting that the group was unable to provide timely feedback on the draft NAPA in Portuguese owing to the resignation of the Portuguese-speaking LEG member. 8. The LEG discussed the status of preparation of NAPAs |  on the basis of its survey at COP 12 |  information from LDC Parties and updated information from GEF implementing agencies. The LEG noted that several NAPAs were at an advanced stage of preparation and that NAPA teams continue to need support |  particularly in relation to steps 2 (synthesize available vulnerability assessments) and 8 (develop project profiles and submit the completed NAPA) of the NAPA process.3 9. The LEG discussed its ongoing efforts to collaborate with the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (CGE) and the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) |  and efforts of the UNFCCC in response to the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change |  and the Buenos Aires programme of work on adaptation and response measures contained in decision 1/CP.10. It also considered the complementary efforts of other United Nations agencies in support of LDCs and NAPAs |  and welcomed the collaboration on the development of a response to disaster risk reduction in LDCs. 10. The LEG concluded that these efforts should continue |  particularly as they relate to the fulfilment of its mandate. The Chair of the LEG was invited to consult with the Chairs of the CGE and EGTT at the twenty-sixth sessions of the subsidiary bodies on training in the use of the guidebook on preparing and presenting proposals that was developed by the UNFCCC in collaboration with the EGTT | 4 the assessment of adaptation technology needs of NAPAs and a report on integrating the results of NAPAs into second national communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention. 2. Least Developed Countries Expert Group comments on draft national adaptation programmes of action 11. In accordance with decision 29/CP.7 |  annex |  paragraph 9 (a) |  the LEG provided comments on the draft NAPAs of Benin |  Burundi |  the Democratic Republic of the Congo |  Liberia |  Sao Tome and Principe |  and Tuvalu. 12. The LEG reviewed the results of its efforts to improve its responsiveness to requests |  noting that several NAPA teams had provided a positive response to its comments. The LEG noted that project profiles continued to be presented in varying levels of detail |  and that the linkage between steps 2 and 8 continues to engage the attention of NAPA teams. 13. The LEG considered support to the Portuguese-speaking NAPA team that had submitted its draft NAPA for comments and agreed that a LEG member would provide comments on the draft NAPA on behalf of the group. 14. The LEG noted the efforts of the implementing agencies of the GEF |  the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) |  the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |  with technical support from the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) |  to provide technical advice on completing NAPAs. It took particular note of the NAPA website <http://www.napa-pana.org> |  which serves to communicate to all users information such as its feedback |  |  |  | 3 |  |  |  | Annotated guidelines for the preparation of national adaptation programmes of action |  available at: <http://unfccc.int/files/cooperation_and_support/ldc/application/pdf/annguide.pdf>. 4 Preparing and presenting proposals: A guidebook on preparing technology transfer projects for financing |  available at: <http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/publications/pract_guide_06_en.pdf>. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/12 Page 5 on draft NAPAs to NAPA teams |  the information provided to the NAPA team leaders by UNEP in its technical note no. 4 and UNITAR’s revised technical sheets on steps 2 and 8 of the NAPA process. B. Consideration of efforts to facilitate preparation of the national adaptation programmes of action 15. The Chair of the LEG briefed the group on the discussions at SBI 25 with representatives of the implementing agencies of the GEF |  UNEP and UNDP |  with technical support from UNITAR |  to assist Parties in the NAPA process |  to address the capacity-building needs for NAPAs and to further facilitate support provided for the development of project proposals for funding. 16. The LEG was advised of the schedule of activities proposed by UNITAR in support of NAPA preparation for 2007. It was noted that a NAPA training workshop for LDCs and small island developing States (SIDS) in the Asia Pacific region |  which had been discussed at the margins of SBI 25 |  was scheduled to follow LEG 11 in Honiara from 29 to 31 March 2007. 17. The NAPA workshop for LDC Parties in the Asia region initially proposed to take place in 2006 was discussed and a new date proposed for the third quarter of 2007. The training workshop is designed to assist LDCs in the Asia region that have started the NAPA preparation and are in need of technical advice and guidance in order to progress further. C. Consideration of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group and its expected outcomes 18. The work programme of the LEG was further considered by the LEG at its eleventh meeting on the basis of the organization of the work agreed at its tenth meeting. Five task teams were established at LEG 10; each was led by a LEG member to coordinate efforts to implement its mandate. 19. The discussion on the LEG work programme 2006–2007 was guided by technical reports containing a compilation and synthesis of information contained in 11 NAPAs submitted to the secretariat as at 31 January 2007 |  namely from Bangladesh |  Bhutan |  Comoros |  Djibouti |  Haiti |  Kiribati |  Madagascar |  Malawi |  Mauritania |  Niger and Samoa. The technical reports were based on two templates designed by the LEG to extract information from the NAPAs on the application of the NAPA guidelines contained in the annex to decision 28/CP.7 |  and to compile information on prioritized projects and activities contained in the project profiles. 20. One of the technical reports |  in an effort to assist the LEG in improving and facilitating support to LDCs that have yet to submit their NAPAs |  served to identify problems encountered by the LDCs in their use of the guidelines. The second technical report compiled and synthesized information provided in submitted NAPAs |  with particular reference to the project profiles. The two reports also identified problems encountered by the LDCs during the preparation of NAPAs and assessed the financial |  technical and technological assistance requirements as well as the capacity-building needed for the implementation of NAPA projects. 21. In addition |  in the context of considering its work programme |  the LEG examined updated information from NAPA teams and the implementing agencies on technical constraints being encountered in the preparation of NAPAs |  as well as information on financial and technical needs and support that can assist NAPA implementation. 22. The outcome of the LEG’s consideration of its work programme was to identify elements that would need to be considered in preparation for its stocktaking meeting |  through the production of background papers |  in plenary sessions organized around the activities mandated in decision 29/CP.7 and in related open discussions. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/12 Page 6 23. The LEG agreed to further consider and report to the SBI |  at its twenty-seventh session |  on the fulfilment of its mandate on the basis of work it has undertaken and results gathered from the stocktaking meeting. D. Planning for the Least Developed Countries Expert Group stocktaking meeting 24. At its eleventh meeting |  the LEG agreed that the main objectives of the stocktaking meeting would be to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the status of NAPA preparation; to facilitate the sharing of experiences in NAPA preparation and implementation; to identify best practices in NAPA preparation; to guide project implementation; and to consider how best to mainstream NAPA activities into national development planning. 25. Drawing upon the work undertaken in the task teams |  the two technical reports |  the results of its questionnaires and a scoping paper |  the LEG began the process of considering the elements to be discussed at the meeting by describing the inputs it would provide. It also considered inputs to the meeting that would be required from the GEF and its implementing agencies |  identifying capacitybuilding needs as well as expected contributions from relevant actors to assist in the conduct of the meeting. 26. The Chair of the LEG was requested to consult further with relevant actors in detailing arrangements for the meeting. The LEG agreed to provide to its Chair additional inputs for the meeting |  based on the work being undertaken in reviewing submitted NAPAs |  or on further interactions with NAPA teams. 27. The LEG also requested the Chair of the LEG to have further discussions |  at the margins of SBI 26 |  with the GEF and its implementing agencies |  relevant United Nations agencies |  regional initiatives |  and multilateral and bilateral support agencies that support LDCs in the NAPA process. E. Interaction of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group with national adaptation programme of action teams of the Maldives |  Solomon Islands |  Tuvalu and Vanuatu 28. The LEG |  on the last day of its meeting |  conducted an open interactive session with representatives of the NAPA teams that were in the Solomon Islands to participate in the training workshop referred to in paragraph 16. Inputs to the interaction between the LEG and the NAPA teams were also provided by technical resource personnel representing the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme |  the UNDP regional office based in Samoa |  and UNITAR representatives responsible for the conduct of the workshop. 29. The NAPA team representatives indicated that they are at varying stages of NAPA preparation and that three draft NAPAs would be considered at the workshop. 30. One NAPA team indicated that it was in the final process of incorporating comments from the LEG on its draft NAPA in order to submit it for endorsement by its government. Another two indicated that they were well advanced in the process |  with nearly completed documents to be considered at the workshop |  which included project profiles proposed for funding. The fourth team indicated that |  after protracted discussions |  it was still in the process of finalizing the national institutional arrangements with its implementing agency to start the implementation of the approved NAPA document. 31. The NAPA teams |  in presenting their overview |  briefed the LEG on the status of preparation of their NAPA as well as on problems and constraints encountered in the NAPA process. They indicated that institutional arrangements |  stakeholder consultations and efforts to undertake steps 2 and 8 of the NAPA process are still engaging their attention. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/12 Page 7 32. On the issue of the proposed national institutional arrangements |  one team indicated that the proposed modifications to an approved NAPA project document are delaying the initiation of the implementation of their NAPA. 33. Discussions included the particular challenges of undertaking stakeholder consultations that would involve national |  regional and government agencies as well as local communities |  nongovernmental organizations and the private sector across island groups such as the Solomon Islands. It was noted that the NAPA process recommends that consultations need to be based on a representative sampling of affected communities at the national |  sectoral and local community level of islands and communities. 34. With respect to step 2 of the NAPA process |  the identification |  from available vulnerability assessments |  of the vulnerable sectors and the root cause of their vulnerability to climate change presents a challenge |  as different biogeographic regions are represented within countries in the SIDS. It was noted that the regions include both low-lying atolls and high volcanic islands |  and that existing vulnerability studies often do not differentiate between the regions with regard to vulnerability and expected impacts. 35. The development of project profiles (step 8) based on the constraints faced in step 2 had progressed |  but it was noted that the comments received |  for example |  from the LEG |  highlight the problems in the linkages between the two steps. 36. The regional support agencies involved in the LDCs and SIDS of the Asia Pacific region that participated in the open exchange indicated their continuing willingness and desire to assist |  upon request |  at the regional or |  as needed |  at the national level |  the NAPA teams in their NAPA process. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/12 Page 8 Annex |  |  |  | Members of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group as at 31 March 2007 |  | Mr. Erwin Kuenzi Mr. Mahmood H.

Mandate |  | 1. The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by decision 29/CP.7 |  established the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) to advise on the preparation and implementation strategy for national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs). Under its current term (2011–2015) |  the LEG mandate includes providing support to the least developed countries (LDCs) on NAPAs |  the LDC work programme and the national adaptation plan (NAP) process. 2. In response to decision 6/CP.16 |  the LEG developed a work programme for 2012– 20131 at its twenty-first meeting |  which was considered by the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) at its thirty-sixth session. The SBI endorsed the work programme of the LEG for 2012–2013 and requested the LEG to report on its work to the SBI at each of its sessions | 2 in accordance with decision 6/CP.16. |  |  |  | II. Summary of the twenty-second meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | A. Proceedings |  | 3. The twenty-second meeting of the LEG was held in Funafuti |  Tuvalu |  from 26 to 29 September 2012. 4. The meeting was opened jointly with the LEG regional training workshop for the Pacific LDCs by the Prime Minister of Tuvalu |  Mr. Willy Telavi. He welcomed the LEG and the participants to the workshop in Tuvalu. He highlighted the particular vulnerability of Tuvalu |  as a low-lying coral atoll |  to the impacts of climate change. He also noted the importance of the LEG and its support to the LDCs and voiced his pleasure in hosting its twenty-second meeting and the workshop. 5. During the meeting |  the LEG focused its work on technical guidelines for the NAP process |  support needs for the NAP process |  regional training workshops on adaptation for the LDCs for 2012–2013 |  preparation and implementation of NAPAs |  LEG outreach activities |  case studies of existing national adaptation strategies and plans |  adaptation technology for the LDCs |  monitoring and evaluation of NAPAs and the LDC work programme |  in-depth case studies in the LDCs |  mobilization and collaboration with relevant organizations |  agencies |  regional centres and networks |  and linkages with other bodies under the Convention. |  |  |  | B. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Status of the preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action |  | Status of the preparation of national adaptation programmes of action 6. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) reported that |  as at 29 September 2012 |  49 LDCs had been supported with funding for the preparation of their NAPAs with grants amounting to USD 11.76 million. Out of those |  47 LDCs have successfully completed their |  | 1 |  |  |  | 2 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  annex I. A detailed version of the work programme |  including specific objectives |  expected outcomes and a timeline |  is available on the UNFCCC website at <http://unfccc.int/6897>. FCCC/SBI/2011/7 |  paragraph 88. 3 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  |  |  | NAPAs. Of the two remaining |  Myanmar is in the final stages of NAPA preparation and Somalia |  which received funding in June 2012 |  is in the early stages of preparation. 7. At least three LDCs |  including Bangladesh |  Bhutan and Senegal |  have revised and/or updated their NAPAs. The LEG took note that the LDCs continue to rely on technical guidance and advice in revising and updating their NAPAs and that it stands ready to provide support upon request. 2. Status of the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 8. With regard to the implementation of NAPAs |  the GEF reported that of the 47 LDCs that have completed their NAPAs |  45 had officially submitted one or more NAPA projects to the GEF in the form of a project identification form (PIF). Twenty-five countries had submitted at least two projects and 10 had submitted three or more projects. 9. The GEF indicated that |  in total |  82 projects (comprising six medium-sized projects and 76 full-sized projects) had been approved by the GEF Council |  with Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) grants amounting to USD 357.85 million. Of the projects approved |  42 had been endorsed by the Chief Executive Officer of the GEF and are under various stages of implementation. 10. The GEF further reported that |  as at 31 August 2012 |  donors had pledged USD 537.99 million to the LDCF |  and that the new ceiling for each LDC for implementing NAPA projects had been set at USD 20 million |  based on the principle of equitable access. |  |  |  | C. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Technical guidance and support to the national adaptation plan process |  | Technical guidelines for national adaptation plans 11. The COP |  by decision 5/CP.17 |  adopted the initial guidelines for the formulation of NAPs by the LDC Parties.3 It requested the LEG to prepare technical guidelines for the NAP process based on the initial guidelines. The LEG continued its work on the technical guidelines based on the approach discussed during the twenty-first meeting of the LEG.4 12. Following the structure contained in the initial guidelines |  the LEG elaborated ideas on the steps |  guiding questions and tasks for each of the phases and steps of the NAP process. It considered options for decision support tools |  the expected outputs and the components of a monitoring and evaluation system for the respective phases and steps of the NAP process. 13. The LEG discussed approaches to enable each country to define its entry point |  based on existing circumstances and progress in addressing adaptation at the national level. The LEG further discussed potential decision-making processes and the role of various national institutional arrangements for an effective NAP process. The LEG noted that in addition to existing national climate change focal points |  the NAP process will benefit from the engagement of broader institutional arrangements covering all dimensions of society |  as well as scientific and/or research institutions. 14. The LEG also touched upon potential reporting channels for the LDCs on their NAP process |  which included communication of progress through national communications |  wide dissemination of a completed NAP as part of the NAP process |  including through the secretariat |  and updates on the progress of the NAP process through annual information notes and a questionnaire |  including using a web-based questionnaire |  managed by the LEG. |  | 3 4 |  |  |  | Decision 5/CP.17 |  annex. FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  paragraphs 22–27. |  |  |  | 4 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  |  |  | 15. The LEG also discussed its activities to support the NAP process |  including through the provision of information material to support the launch of the national process and subsequent steps. In addition |  it touched upon the need for strengthening the role of the national climate change focal points in initiating and guiding the process. It was agreed that clearer guidance is needed on how to monitor and evaluate the NAP process |  including the establishment of baselines and the formulation of appropriate indicators. The LEG will address that issue through the elaboration of the monitoring and evaluation approach paper and case studies on NAPAs |  the LDC work programme and NAPs. 16. The LEG worked on the technical guidelines in preparation for the review meeting on those guidelines |  which took place on 29–31 October 2012 |  in Bonn |  Germany. 2. Support needs for national adaptation plans 17. The COP requested5 the LEG to identify support needs for the process of the formulation and implementation of NAPs. 18. In considering that item |  the LEG reflected on its past work in analysing adaptation projects in the LDCs |  in particular the experience of the LDCs in implementing NAPA projects |  as well as other programmes such as the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience6 and the Africa Adaptation Programme.7 The LEG also used the results of the country interviews it conducts during the subsidiary body sessions. The interviews provide an opportunity for the LEG to collect information from the LDCs on NAPAs |  the LDC work programme and the NAP process. The LEG recognized that the LDCs are at different stages in terms of their capacity and needs in addressing adaptation |  and that each country will likely need to select specific tasks under the NAP process based on national circumstances. 19. The LEG identified the following initial list of areas for which support would be needed by the LDCs in undertaking the NAP process |  and which could be delivered through the various modalities listed in decision 5/CP.17 |  paragraph 12: (a) Defining capacities for essential functions at the national level necessary to address adaptation |  the identification of gaps based on an analysis of existing capacities and the implementation of strategies and activities to address the gaps; (b) Understanding of existing policies and how they address and enable climate change adaptation with a view to revising or designing new legislation and policies |  where needed |  to facilitate successful adaptation; (c) Design of research and systematic observations to support vulnerability and risk analysis and adaptation planning; (d) Data collection |  management and archiving |  and subsequent analysis covering all relevant sectors and disciplines |  including analysis of observed and simulated climate data |  and subsequent presentation of such data and analyses to various stakeholders to support decision-making; (e) Use of appropriate geospatial data management and analysis tools in managing data and information over space and time |  to underpin assessments as part of adaptation planning and the iterative and ongoing nature of such assessments as part of the NAP process; (f) Analysis of climate data and the development and application of climate change scenarios in assessing climate change risks at the national |  sectoral and local levels; |  | 5 6 7 |  |  |  | Decision 5/CP.17 |  paragraph 16. <http://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org/cif/ppcr>. <http://www.undp-aap.org/>. 5 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  |  |  | (g) Design and conduct of vulnerability and adaptation assessments |  including the development and application of assessment models |  application of applicable decision support tools |  such as cost–benefit analysis |  and the ranking of adaptation options; (h) Development of strategies |  projects and programmes to support the implementation of specific adaptation activities under the NAP process |  taking into account existing adaptation efforts and how financing is being provided; (i) Synthesizing the best available science on climate change |  as well as other forms of knowledge |  and translating it into support for decision-making |  including how to make such decisions considering the uncertainty of future climate change; (j) Integration of NAPs into national development plans and priorities |  including by facilitating recognition of climate risks and the need for adaptation within relevant policies |  integrating climate change vulnerability and risks in the formulation of policies |  and prioritizing resource allocation to the areas |  sectors or populations most at risk; (k) Access to information and experience of others in applying different technologies in adaptation to facilitate the selection |  installation and operation of appropriate technologies for local problems; (l) Financial and technical support for the NAP process |  including for the formulation and implementation of adaptation measures as well as identified gaps in capacity for successful adaptation planning; (m) Design and operation of innovative financing for climate change |  including issues of direct access |  absorption of funds and setting up trust funds and other national climate change funds; (n) Design of effective monitoring and evaluation systems |  including for overall coordination of work at the national or sectoral levels |  in defining objectives and targets |  selecting indicators and means of verification |  identifying data sources and collection methods |  supporting data and information management |  undertaking special assessments |  and facilitating reporting and review; (o) Capture and management of knowledge on impacts |  vulnerabilities and adaptations |  to build up a decision-support system for future adaptation planning |  including through the development of knowledge bases and expert or rule-based systems; (p) Development and deployment of communications |  public awareness and outreach on adaptation and the facilitation of public access to information on climate change adaptation |  including an easy to read short summary of the NAP process that could be used by the LDCs and translated into local languages; (q) Communication of up-to-date information on organizations |  regional centres and networks that can provide support to the LDCs on the NAP process |  including on financial support |  technical guides and papers |  and capacity-building; (r) Exchange of case studies |  experiences |  best practices and lessons learned in addressing adaptation at the national |  regional and international levels; (s) Communicating the above needs through an international event that could bring together the LEG |  LDC Parties |  adaptation practitioners |  organizations |  development agencies |  regional centres and networks |  as a way to: set a stage for sharing information on the NAP process and how it will build on the NAPAs and fit in with other existing adaptation initiatives at the national level in LDCs; and to provide an opportunity for the LDCs to communicate their support needs for the NAP process |  and to jointly discuss support activities for the LDCs for the NAP process with the entities mentioned in this paragraph. |  |  |  | 6 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  |  |  | 3. |  |  |  | Compilation of case studies on national adaptation strategies and plans 20. In its work programme for 2012–2013 |  the LEG compiled information on approaches and steps used by different countries in designing medium- and long-term adaptation plans |  using a case study approach. 21. During the meeting |  the LEG discussed in detail examples from Nigeria |  United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and United States of America showing their progress from starting to address adaptation |  to the process of institutionalizing adaptation and the development of national adaptation plans. The case studies included the years in which milestones were reached and the respective administrative levels involved. The LEG further looked into examples from other locations |  namely Australia |  Bangladesh |  Germany |  the New York State of the United States and the Caribbean Community States. 22. The LEG acknowledged the usefulness of looking at other country examples and identified important lessons and key points to consider from the case studies |  including the institutional set-up for developing NAPs |  legislative requirements of adaptation activities |  useful indicators for prioritization and timelines considered in the examples for the implementation process. 23. The LEG also identified several aspects to be further analysed and elaborated upon |  including the following: (a) The financial resources used by countries to produce their plans; |  |  |  | (b) The institutional arrangements |  especially those of the LDCs that have embarked on adaptation planning; (c) The legal requirements of adaptation activities in the case study countries; |  |  |  | (d) Additional case studies showing different approaches and an analytical comparison |  for example with regard to the prioritization of adaptation actions |  mainstreaming adaptation into development planning |  and best practices and lessons learned. |  |  |  | D. |  |  |  | Regional training workshops for 2012–2013 |  | 24. The LEG is scheduled to conduct regional training workshops on adaptation for the LDCs in accordance with its work programme for 2012–2013. At its twenty-first meeting |  the LEG agreed on the objectives |  expected outcomes |  topics |  methodology |  selection of participants and tentative schedule for the workshops.8 25. The LEG worked on the final elements of the training materials for the workshops |  mainly focusing on tailoring the interactive discussions |  specific themes and case studies for the Pacific LDCs workshop that took place from 28 September to 3 October 2012 in Funafuti. 26. The LEG further discussed the logistical arrangements for the remaining regional workshops |  one for anglophone African LDCs |  one for francophone LDCs and one for Asian LDCs. Lusophone LDCs will be able to attend either the African anglophone or francophone training workshops. The LEG agreed to strive to hold all three workshops in the first half of the year. 27. The LEG discussed how the training materials for the workshops could be enriched with case studies and examples drawn from key issues specific to each region |  drawing |  |  |  | 8 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/7 |  paragraphs 15–18. 7 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  |  |  | upon resource persons with expertise in each of the regions. The materials would also need to be translated into appropriate languages. 28. In organizing the Pacific LDCs workshop |  the LEG worked together with various organizations |  agencies and regional centres |  through an advisory group that consisted of the GEF and its agencies |  regional organizations and development agencies in the Pacific region |  and representatives of the Pacific LDCs. In particular |  the GEF and three of its agencies (the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |  the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)) |  two regional organizations (the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) and the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP)) |  two development agencies (Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)) and the United States Agency for International Development ADAPT Asia-Pacific Project played significant roles in developing materials related to specific topics of the workshop. Representatives of AusAID |  FAO |  the GEF |  GIZ |  SPC and SPREP attended the workshop and served as resource persons. 29. The LEG collected early feedback from the participants and the resource persons on the workshop in order to assess the impact of the workshop and potential areas for improvement. The feedback pointed to the need to include more examples and case studies from the region in the training materials. The LEG agreed that overall feedback on the workshop will be collected through a questionnaire |  the results of which will be compiled and used to inform the work of the LEG |  including the organization of the remaining workshops. |  |  |  | E. |  |  |  | Technology in national adaptation programmes of action |  | 30. The LEG discussed the role and application of technology in addressing vulnerability and adaptation in the LDCs |  looking at both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ technologies. The LEG addressed a number of opportunities for the application of adaptation technology in different sectors |  including agriculture |  fisheries |  forestry |  water resources |  coastal zones |  urban areas and human health. 31. Case studies from different regions were discussed |  including a glacial lake outburst flood early warning system in Bhutan |  a climate-resilient rice production system in Sierra Leone and floating islands in Maldives. The LEG noted the importance of exploring other examples on adaptation technology. 32. The LEG further considered the potential challenges for technology transfer and diffusion |  with human capacity emerging as a key challenge for the LDCs in terms of the operation |  installation and maintenance of adaptation technologies. Members discussed the importance of sharing practical information about what technologies exist and how they can be accessed. 33. The LEG proposed expanding its outreach efforts on adaptation technologies |  including through an expansion of the local coping strategies database.9 That will be done with a view to promoting the exchange of best practices and innovative ideas among countries and regions. That effort will be further enhanced through the best practices platform on the LDC portal.10 The LEG Chair will interact with the Chair of the Technology Executive Committee (TEC) to explore how to best collaborate on its work on adaptation technologies. |  | 9 10 |  |  |  | <http://maindb.unfccc.int/public/adaptation>. <unfccc.int/4751>. |  |  |  | 8 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  |  |  | F. |  |  |  | Outreach on national adaptation programmes of action |  the least developed countries work programme |  national adaptation plans and the work of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | Best practices and lessons learned in addressing adaptation in the least developed countries 34. The LEG discussed the outline and the progress made in drafting the second volume of the best practices and lessons learned publication. The publication will focus on the implementation aspects of NAPAs |  including the experience of the GEF agencies |  and other adaptation initiatives in the LDCs. 35. The publication will present best practices and lessons learned on the following themes: (a) The role of institutional arrangements in ensuring effective alignment of adaptation planning with broader development planning and national systems; (b) Effective coordination of national programmes to ensure long-term sustainability; (c) The role of the climate change focal point in promoting the active engagement of relevant stakeholders within and outside the government; (d) Strengthening considerations of vulnerability by targeting vulnerable groups; |  |  |  | 1. |  |  |  | (e) Approaches for the mobilization of financial resources |  including the organization of donor round tables and the setting up of national trust funds; (f) Experience with accessing resources under the LDCF |  including adopting a programmatic approach at the national level as well as implementing adaptation measures that are not only tied to capacity-building but also to concrete projects; (g) Experience with developing and managing adaptation projects |  taking into account the diverse procedures among GEF agencies and other development agencies and stakeholders; (h) The importance of documenting the national adaptation process from data or information and assessments |  through to the terminal and subsequent reports of adaptation projects; (i) Monitoring and evaluation of adaptation measures at the project and national levels for planning and implementation; (j) 2. Consideration of deploying sectoral approaches at the regional level. |  |  |  | Least developed countries portal 36. The LEG discussed the progress made in the new phase of the enhancement of the LDC portal |  including progress in designing a NAPA information system and enhanced web pages on information about the work of the LEG. It noted that this will form only one part of its greater outreach effort |  given the difficulties some LDCs face in terms of Internet access. It discussed the different components of the enhancement |  which are as follows: (a) An online collaboration platform for the LEG |  the LDCs and relevant organizations |  agencies and regional centres to share information |  experiences and best practices and lessons learned on NAPAs |  the NAP process |  the LDC work programme and the work of the LEG; |  |  |  | 9 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  |  |  | (b) A NAPA information system to showcase information on NAPAs submitted to the secretariat |  including revisions and updates |  identified priorities |  including by sectors and/or themes |  projects being implemented under the LDCF and any other information from relevant partners on the implementation of NAPAs; (c) A NAP common information system to serve as a central hub for information on the NAP process to support COP considerations on NAPs |  to show progress made by countries on their national processes |  including a repository of relevant NAP documents |  and to support the LDCs with links to relevant data |  information and tools for the NAP process |  to be populated with inputs from countries as well as from relevant organizations |  regional centres and networks |  and the research community. That would be realized through enhanced mobilization of those in a position to contribute data and information; (d) A best practices and lessons learned platform as a central knowledge hub for sharing country experiences |  case studies |  and outreach materials |  best practices and lessons learned in the LDCs in addressing adaptation through NAPAs |  NAPs and the LDC work programme; (e) A LEG platform that will serve as a user-friendly interactive interface for the compilation and dissemination of technical guides |  tools |  information and outputs of the LEG for easy access by the LDC Parties; (f) An LDC monitor that will serve as an information system to support monitoring and evaluation of adaptation in the LDCs through NAPAs |  NAPs and the LDC work programme. 37. The LEG devoted time to further refine the concept and requirements of the NAP common information system |  which can serve as a global information hub for the NAP process. It will offer a gateway to the NAP technical guidelines |  global and regional data and information that would be useful for the NAP process in countries |  access to commonly used tools and models |  and links to information sources from partnering agencies and organizations involved in supporting the NAP process. The common information system is motivated by lessons learned from the NAPA process |  where multiple web sites offered information on NAPAs |  but over time some sites were not updated |  leading to less than optimal information being shared on NAPAs. The LEG hopes that this will reduce confusion among the LDCs and other stakeholders. As with the development of any information system |  the LEG will pilot the system and collect feedback to further enhance its design |  and will carefully assess its utility. 3. Least developed countries information note 38. As another form of outreach |  the LEG will continue to share on a regular basis news on the LDC work programme through an information note to the LDCs |  as a means of further enhancing communication between the LEG and the LDCs. The next information note will be sent before COP 18 and will provide an update of NAPA preparation and implementation |  funds available per LDC under the LDCF |  a short summary of the LEG’s twenty-second meeting and training workshop for the Pacific LDCs |  and any upcoming deadlines for invitation for submissions from Parties under the UNFCCC process. |  |  |  | G. |  |  |  | Monitoring and evaluation of national adaptation programmes of action and the least developed countries work programme |  | 39. The LEG discussed the outline for an approach paper on the monitoring and evaluation of NAPAs and the LDC work programme. It recommended balancing the approach paper to give equal recognition to the monitoring and the evaluation of national |  |  |  | 10 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  |  |  | adaptation processes. For that |  it suggested defining clear and |  to the extent possible |  quantitative goals for the NAPA process and the LDC work programme. Furthermore |  it recommended departing from a general discussion of the monitoring and evaluation of adaptation to a more detailed analysis of requirements for a national monitoring and evaluation system. The LEG agreed to consider the approach paper at its next meeting. |  |  |  | H. |  |  |  | Conducting in-depth case studies in the least developed countries |  | 40. The LEG discussed progress and further actions in conducting in-depth case studies in the LDCs. The case studies are |  according to the LEG |  an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the LDCs’ experiences with NAPAs |  the LDC work programme and the NAP process |  with a view to informing the LEG on how to best structure and deliver its support to the LDCs in those areas. Detailed objectives and activities for the case studies are contained in the report on the twenty-first meeting of the LEG. 41. The LEG agreed that the in-depth case studies will |  in the future |  place more emphasis on the link with the case studies on national adaptation processes and strategies |  in addition to NAPAs and the LDC work programme. Furthermore |  the LEG agreed that the case studies will need to include an understanding of experiences and capacity needs in the LDCs with respect to the monitoring and evaluation of adaptation |  and the costing of adaptation measures |  including the management of financing for adaptation at the national level. 42. The LEG noted that two case studies |  for the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and for Malawi |  had been carried out. The LEG agreed that additional in-depth case studies need to be carried out in more countries |  and that they should seek to strike a balance across all the geographical regions in order to cover the different contexts. |  |  |  | I. |  |  |  | Linkages with other bodies under the Convention |  | 43. The LEG discussed linkages with other bodies under the Convention |  in particular the Adaptation Committee (AC) |  the TEC and the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (CGE). 44. The LEG discussed linkages with the AC based on relevant mandates from the COP |  such as in decisions 2/CP.17 and 5/CP.17.11 The LEG raised the following recommendations for possible consideration by the AC as it undertakes its work: (a) The AC would integrate and communicate the support needs of the LDC Parties for NAPs while performing its function on exchanging information with relevant Convention bodies and others |  including the Standing Committee and the TEC |  on means to incentivize the implementation of adaptation actions |  including finance |  technology and capacity-building |  with a view to enhancing support to the LDC Parties in addressing adaptation; (b) The AC would prioritize the consideration of regional centres and networks supporting adaptation in the LDCs when making recommendations to Parties on ways to enhance the role of regional centres and networks in supporting adaptation at the regional and national levels. 45. The LEG also noted that it has information on experiences |  best practices and lessons learned in addressing adaptation in the LDCs |  particularly through NAPAs |  the |  |  |  | 11 |  |  |  | Decision 2/CP.17 |  paragraphs 99 and 104 |  and decision 5/CP.17 |  paragraph 17. 11 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  |  |  | LDC work programme and NAPs |  that the AC could draw upon in undertaking its functions. 46. Given the central role of the TEC in addressing technology issues |  the LEG discussed the need for coordination with the TEC on that area. As a first contribution |  the LEG identified issues relating to adaptation technology in the LDCs and the NAPs |  to help the TEC to focus on issues that would directly benefit the LDCs. It suggested that the TEC could assist in providing technical advice and guidance on the following: (a) How the LDCs can address the barriers to adaptation technology development and transfer; (b) Policies and programme priorities related to adaptation technology development and transfer for the LDCs for the NAP process; (c) Appropriate adaptation technologies (through feasibility analyses and cost– benefit analyses) |  as well as their installation |  operation and maintenance. 47. The LEG discussed the possibility of the LEG Chair meeting the Chair of the TEC during SBI sessions to exchange ideas on collaboration. The LEG agreed to communicate with the TEC in the coming months |  to further advance collaboration. 48. It was also discussed that the Climate Technology Centre and Network could play a role as an additional support mechanism for the above-mentioned support needs and that the LEG can learn more about opportunities for utilizing its outputs. 49. With respect to the collaboration with the CGE |  the LEG agreed that the Chair of the LEG will communicate with the Chair of the CGE to share information on the regional training workshops for 2012–2013. |  |  |  | J. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Discussion with the Global Environment Facility and its agencies |  | Proceedings 50. The LEG held discussions with the GEF on the third and fourth days of its meeting. The discussions focused on the latest experiences |  challenges and lessons learned in accessing resources from the LDCF for the implementation of NAPAs |  updates on a UNDP and UNEP proposal for a support programme to assist the LDCs in the NAP process |  collaboration on the NAP technical guidelines and the regional training workshops for 2012–2013. 51. UNDP and UNEP also made written inputs to the meeting on their support to the NAPA process and on their planned support to the LDCs for the NAP process. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Main issues raised 52. The GEF provided an overview of the status of the preparation and implementation of NAPAs (see paras. 6–10 above) |  key trends and support provided by the GEF to the other elements of the LDC work programme as well as to the NAP process. 53. With regard to the preparation and implementation of NAPAs |  the GEF noted that observed trends show that countries are making progress in accessing resources under the LDCF |  particularly in increasing project size and decreasing the time between NAPA completion and the approval of the first NAPA implementation project and between project approval and endorsement by the Chief Executive Officer of the GEF. 54. The GEF provided information on its support |  through the provision of funds under the LDCF |  to the following elements of the LDC work programme: |  |  |  | 12 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  |  |  | (a) Strengthening the capacity of meteorological and hydrological services to collect |  analyse |  interpret and disseminate weather and climate information to support the implementation of NAPAs; (b) Technology transfer; |  |  |  | (c) Public awareness |  capacity-building for negotiators and strengthening existing and |  where needed |  establishing national climate change secretariats and/or focal points. 55. The GEF underlined that it stands ready |  together with its agencies |  to support the NAP process in the LDCs through the LDCF based on its experience and through its operational modalities. However |  it informed the LEG that additional |  designated contributions to the LDCF would be needed for the GEF to support the NAP process. 56. The UNDP input focused on its support to the LDCs in accessing funding through the LDCF |  the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) |  the GEF Trust Fund |  the Adaptation Fund (AF) and bilateral sources (Australia and Japan). It listed the projects supported in different LDCs and elaborated on the LDCs currently supported to convert approved concepts (PIFs) to implementable projects. It also discussed the LDCs that are currently supported to access additional finance from the LDCF (concept development) and highlighted support for NAPA priorities. 57. Other relevant support provided by UNDP to the LDCs includes support with strengthening the capacities of ministries of finance and planning. That support includes climate public expenditure and institutional reviews |  the Capacity Building Programme on the Economics of Climate Change Adaptation and the Boots on the Ground Programme |  which aims to improve the capacity of governments and other stakeholders to integrate climate change concerns into development planning and policy processes. 58. The input also reported on UNDP’s efforts in supporting the LDCs to undertake NAPs |  through support with readiness preparation |  accessing finance and implementing NAP priorities that emerge. 59. UNEP also made an input on its continued support to the LDCs. It mentioned how it supports the LDCs to access funds from the LDCF |  SCCF and AF and how it implements the UNEP Ecosystem-based Adaptation Programme and other related initiatives. It elaborated on progress made by different LDCs in both NAPA preparation and implementation. 60. In terms of future support |  UNEP’s input elaborated that the UNEP GEF Climate Change Adaptation unit will continue to assist countries to access funds from the LDCF |  SCCF and AF to implement the priorities laid out in their NAPAs. In addition |  it will assist the LDCs to develop and implement NAPs |  by helping them to develop tools and methodologies for long-term adaptation planning. |  |  |  | K. |  |  |  | Collaboration with other relevant organizations |  agencies and regional centres |  | 61. Building on the work of its twenty-first meeting |  the LEG continued the discussion on the mobilization of regional organizations |  centres and networks |  as well as global entities with regional programmes |  that could add value to the NAP process. The LEG updated its list of entities to be engaged for that purpose |  identifying entities with work areas that can directly enhance the LEG’s support to the LDCs for the implementation of the LDC work programme and for the NAP process. The LEG focused |  in particular |  on entities that can be mobilized to support the upcoming regional training workshops. |  |  |  | 13 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  |  |  | 62. As a step forward in engaging relevant organizations |  agencies and regional centres |  the LEG organized the Pacific LDCs workshop through an advisory group that consisted of the GEF and its agencies |  regional organizations and development agencies in the Pacific region and representatives of the Pacific LDCs (see para. 28 above). The LEG agreed to continue to engage relevant organizations |  agencies and regional centres in all its areas of work |  including the organization of the remaining regional training workshops for 2012– 2013. |  |  |  | L. |  |  |  | Interaction with the Tuvalu national adaptation programme of action team |  | 63. In keeping with its practice of interacting with the NAPA team of the host country |  the LEG conducted an interactive session with representatives of the Tuvalu NAPA team. The team |  represented by the NAPA project coordinator and members of the board of the NAPA |  including a village chief |  presented Tuvalu’s experience in addressing adaptation through the NAPA |  and led the LEG on a field visit to three NAPA project implementation sites in Funafuti. 64. The Tuvalu NAPA team shared its experience with accessing resources from the LDCF. The team mentioned that it took longer to access resources from the LDCF than it does for accessing resources from other forms of support |  such as bilateral support programmes. The team members also indicated that they often faced difficulties on agreement with the implementing agency on the budget for project activities despite the unique circumstances in Tuvalu. As an example |  the team indicated that transport costs are always higher than any other project costs |  owing to the remoteness of the islands |  which usually results in higher costs than the global estimates usually used by the implementing agencies. The team members also indicated they have to rely on inter-island boat transport |  which has a limited schedule and carrying capacity |  often resulting in delays in implementing activities. 65. On further experiences |  the team indicated that one of the primary challenges had been high staff turnover. However |  NAPA project boards established on each island have helped to keep the institutional memory of the projects and facilitated smooth progress in the implementation of projects despite staff changes. 66. The team took the LEG to three NAPA project implementation sites in Funafuti: two sites for the planting of trees (pulaka trees) to prevent further coastal erosion and one site for piloting salt-tolerant pit grown taro. The team demonstrated how the local communities are engaged in the projects |  including local schools. Students from local schools are assigned to look after and care for the trees |  which they helped to plant along the coast. |  |  |  | III. Update on priority activities of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2012–2013 |  | 67. In fulfilling its work programme for 2012–2013 |  the LEG identified several activities that have contributed |  or would contribute |  directly to prioritized support for the formulation and implementation of national adaptation plans.12 Those include producing and launching the NAP technical guidelines following a peer review |  identifying support needs for NAPs and prioritizing those needs that can be addressed under its current work programme |  further expanding its work on compiling and synthesizing information on steps of the NAP process |  integrating elements of the NAP process in the design of the upcoming |  | 12 |  |  |  | Decision 5/CP.17 |  paragraph 14. |  |  |  | 14 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  |  |  | LEG training workshops to be held in 2013 and enhancing the LDC portal to offer a common platform on information on the NAP process. 68. The LEG concluded that good progress has been made in implementing its work programme and that most of the activities are on track. It |  however |  further recognized that the LDC Parties will continue to need support as they continue with the implementation of their NAPAs and are now about to initiate NAP processes at their national levels. |  |  |  | 15 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2012/27 |  |  |  | Annex |  | Members of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group as at 26 September 2012 |  | Mr. Abias Huongo Mr. Ibila Djibril Mr. Thinley Namgyel Ms. Beth Lavender Mr. Matti Nummelin Mr. Mphethe Tongwane Mr. Bennon Bibbu Yassin Mr. Batu Krishna Uprety Mr. Jan Verhagen Mr. Douglas Yee Mr. Paul Abiziou Tchinguilou Ms. Pepetua Election Latasi Mr. Fredrick Manyika Angola Benin Bhutan Canada Finland Lesotho Malawi Nepal Netherlands Solomon Islands Togo Tuvalu United Republic of Tanzania |  |  |  | 16 |  |  |  |

Mandate |  | 1. The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by its decision 29/CP.7 |  established the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) to advise least developed country (LDC) Parties on the preparation and implementation strategy for national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) |  and adopted the terms of reference of the LEG. According to these terms of reference |  the LEG is to convene its meeting twice each year |  and report on its work to the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI). 2. By its decision 4/CP.11 |  the COP decided to extend the mandate of the LEG until 2007 |  under its original terms of reference and to review the progress |  need for continuation and terms of reference of the group |  and to adopt a decision thereon |  at its thirteenth session. At its ninth meeting |  the LEG developed a work programme for 2006−2007 |  in accordance with its mandate to continue providing technical guidance and advice to LDC Parties |  on the preparation and implementation of NAPAs. 3. At its twenty-fifth session | 1 the SBI requested the LEG to convene a meeting |  with the assistance of the secretariat and subject to the availability of resources |  to take stock of the progress made by LDC Parties in NAPA preparation and implementation; and to consult |  through the secretariat |  on input for this meeting |  from the secretariat of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its implementing agencies |  and to report on the outcomes of the meeting to the SBI at its twenty-seventh session. |  |  |  | II. Summary of the twelfth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | 4. The twelfth meeting of the LEG was held in Bangkok |  Thailand |  from 6 to 8 September 2007. The Governments of Belgium |  Canada |  Ireland |  New Zealand and Norway provided financial support for the meeting as well as for the ongoing work of the LEG. 5. The LEG meeting was preceded by the stocktaking meeting mentioned in paragraph 3 above |  which was held in Bangkok from 3 to 5 September 2007.2 The LEG acknowledged the valuable logistical support provided by the Government of Thailand for this meeting. 6. Several LEG members played an active role in the stocktaking meeting |  by providing inputs through the preparation of a background paper |  by making presentations on various issues during the meeting and by chairing sessions and serving as rapporteurs to the discussions. A list of the current membership of the LEG is given in annex I. 7. At its twelfth meeting |  the LEG structured its discussion on the outputs of the stocktaking meeting |  as its involvement in that meeting enabled it to reflect on the feedback from participants on the status of NAPA preparation and implementation |  through the presentations by Parties on their experiences. A. Update on the stocktaking meeting on the preparation of national adaptation programmes of action 1. Status of preparation 8. The stocktaking meeting involved 86 participants from 40 LDC Parties |  eight representatives of |  |  |  | 1 2 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2006/28 |  paragraph 84. The report of the stocktaking meeting is contained in document FCCC/SBI/2007/32. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/31 Page 4 the GEF and its implementing3 and executing4 agencies |  representatives from United Nations specialized agencies |  and resource persons. The GEF and its agencies also provided valuable input to the stocktaking meeting. 9. The information available to the LEG indicates that 44 NAPA preparation proposals have been approved for funding by the GEF and that a further two NAPAs (from Angola and Timor-Leste) are in the pipeline for approval. Of these |  22 have been completed and submitted to the UNFCCC secretariat as at 30 September 2007 and a further 13 are described as well advanced in the preparation process. The submitted NAPAs are available on the UNFCCC website.5 10. During the stocktaking meeting |  participants identified several issues relating to NAPA preparation |  which were discussed on the first day. On the basis of the issues raised |  the LEG proposed possible solutions and follow-up actions |  and identified who can address them. A compilation of these issues and possible actions is presented in annex II. 11. Based on the information presented by participants from LDCs and the GEF and its agencies |  the LEG noted that countries are at various stages of preparation of their NAPAs. Although many countries are in the final stages of preparation of their NAPAs |  some are still making technical refinements based on new vulnerabilities that have been identified and a few are continuing with national consultations and/or are seeking political endorsement prior to submission. 12. The LEG further noted that LDC Parties continue to require technical assistance |  and the group therefore expects to receive more requests for technical feedback on draft NAPAs. Additionally |  the LEG was informed of the status of new requests for funding to the GEF by Angola and Timor-Leste for the preparation of their NAPAs. Representatives from these countries pointed out that targeted support would be needed to assist LDC Parties that have recently started the NAPA process |  and in particular those that are lusophone countries. The LEG also identified follow-up actions by the GEF and its agencies in this regard. 2. Status of implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 13. On the status of implementation of NAPAs |  the GEF secretariat reported that 10 of the submitted NAPAs (from Bangladesh |  Bhutan |  Cambodia |  Djibouti |  Eritrea |  Malawi |  Mauritania |  Niger |  Samoa and Sudan) are progressing through the operational stages that will lead to implementation. The GEF secretariat also reported on the support and operational modalities it has introduced recently. These modalities are designed to expedite the submission and approval processes to obtain funding for projects and activities from the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF). 14. The LEG noted the efforts of the GEF and its agencies |  the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) |  the World Bank and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |  with technical support from the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) |  to provide technical advice on implementing projects and activities mentioned in submitted NAPAs. It also noted the support from the GEF and its agencies under the GEF expanded opportunities to support LDCs in NAPA implementation. |  |  |  | 3 4 |  |  |  | The United Nations Development Programme |  the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Bank. The African Development Bank |  the Asian Development Bank |  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development |  the Inter-American Development Bank |  the International Fund for Agricultural Development |  the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. 5 <http://unfccc.int/national_reports/napa/items/2719.php>. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/31 Page 5 15. The LEG also took note of the general experiences of LDC Parties in the use of the new modalities for accessing resources from the LDCF |  and of the experiences of Parties in interacting with the GEF and its agencies in the initial stages of preparing for implementation. 16. The LEG noted that several Parties |  including Bangladesh |  Bhutan and Malawi |  are well advanced in initiating implementation activities using the new modalities and |  in particular |  in the preparation of project proposals for funding. 17. Of particular interest to LDC Parties were issues related to the co-financing of projects |  the experiences of LDCs in preparing proposals for funding from the LDCF |  and the experiences of the GEF and its agencies in supporting NAPA implementation with resources from the LDCF as well as from other sources. The comparative advantages of different GEF agencies in supporting project implementation were described | 6 and Parties were encouraged to request assistance from these agencies according to their competencies and areas of specialization. 18. With respect to accessing resources from the LDCF |  some participants noted that there is a need for more information to be given to LDC Parties on the new procedures being employed by the GEF and its agencies |  which could assist NAPA teams in designing their follow-up to completed NAPAs. Several details were considered relating to the programmatic and project-based approaches to NAPA implementation and the possibility of developing regional projects for funding under the LDCF. The use of baseline and additional cost approaches for estimating the costs associated with implementation |  fullcost funding and the linking of adaptation activities identified in NAPAs to national development activities were also raised as issues for which further clarity is needed |  possibly through strengthened guidance as well as targeted training workshops to assist LDC Parties to further develop their priority NAPA projects. 19. Many country representatives mentioned that the process of selecting agencies remains a challenge. This |  coupled with the need to establish a national donor coordination mechanism in leveraging |  at the national level |  the additional financial and technical support required for implementation was seen as one of the bottlenecks that may determine success of the implementation of NAPAs. 20. United Nations specialized agencies present at the meeting |  such as the United Nations regional economic commissions |  as well as the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) |  provided information on their support for NAPA implementation and on initiatives that could support national efforts. The ISDR |  for example |  described its ability to support implementation by way of technical assistance and capacity-building to strengthen early warning systems and disaster risk reduction activities in NAPAs. 21. The LEG considered the various issues which emerged from the stocktaking meeting related to NAPA implementation |  including: implementation strategy; integration of adaptation into national development planning; the LDCF funding modalities and other opportunities for funding adaptation; and assistance by the GEF agencies as well as other agencies. 22. The scope of the LEG to provide technical advice on NAPA implementation in the future was discussed and the possible interventions are described in annex III. These include: (a) The provision of technical guidance and advice: |  |  |  | 6 |  |  |  | <http://www.gefweb.org/uploadedFiles/Projects/Templates_and_Guidelines/GEF-C-31-5%20rev%201June%2018-2007.pdf>. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/31 Page 6 (i) The LEG considered the need to describe in detail in its comments on draft NAPAs additional responses on the need to develop |  as part of the efforts to complete NAPAs |  a more robust NAPA implementation strategy |  building upon technical paper FCCC/TP/2005/5; The LEG agreed to further consider the technical issues related to the communication of information in NAPAs in order to resolve the identified deficiencies related to steps 2 (synthesis of available information on impact assessments) and 8 (development of projects profiles) in the NAPA annotated guidelines; The LEG also considered developing sectoral issues drawing on information contained in submitted NAPAs |  so as to exchange information among Parties on projects proposed for NAPA implementation; |  |  |  | (ii) |  |  |  | (iii) |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | The exchange of information: the LEG agreed to communicate to the GEF secretariat the need for |  and possible means of |  communicating more comprehensive information to LDC Parties related to NAPA implementation and on its new modalities for accessing resources from the LDCF in the languages used by the Parties accessing the resources; The dissemination of information: (i) The LEG agreed to disseminate more information on NAPA implementation through the UNFCCC website |  in order to facilitate the sharing of national experiences |  and build capacity of LDC Parties in the process; The LEG also considered strengthening efforts to provide training to LDC Parties on the use of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) publication Preparing and presenting proposals: A guidebook on preparing technology transfer projects for financing. |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | (ii) |  |  |  | B. Further needs identified in support of the preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 23. During the exchange of information at the stocktaking meeting |  LDC Parties and the GEF and its agencies also identified needs for technical assistance from the LEG for NAPA preparation and implementation. 24. The request for assistance from the LEG can be grouped into four broad categories: (a) (b) (c) (d) Support to address issues related to lusophone and francophone LDC Parties |  as well as the support described in the LDC work programme (decision 5/CP.7); Continued efforts to monitor bottlenecks in NAPA preparation; Efforts to identify and communicate information through public outreach activities; Provide more detailed information on a thematic basis on areas identified in submitted NAPAs proposed for implementation. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/31 Page 7 C. Consideration of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group and its expected outcomes 25. In implementing its mandate |  as contained in decision 29/CP.7 |  annex |  paragraphs 9 (a)–(e) |  in particular activities and actions related to its work programme for 2006–2007 | 7 and responding to a request from the SBI at its twenty-sixth session |  the LEG has |  through activities undertaken during the period |  achieved the following: (a) Prepared a synthesis of information contained in submitted NAPAs and of information on the extent to which LDC Parties employed the NAPA guidelines in the preparation of their NAPAs. The synthesis of information served as one of the inputs to the LEG stocktaking meeting; Provided advice to LDC Parties during the final phase of NAPA preparation by providing technical advice on the draft NAPA. Of the 22 NAPAs that have been submitted to the UNFCCC secretariat |  the majority have benefited from technical feedback from the LEG; Provided support and input to training workshops and advised LDCs to consider the inclusion of a NAPA implementation strategy in their final NAPAs. Workshops were conducted during 2006–2007 in Nairobi (Kenya) |  Dakar (Senegal) and Honiara (Solomon Islands) |  to which the LEG provided support and technical input; Periodically updated information on the status of NAPA preparation |  through questionnaires and interaction with LDC Parties that were preparing their NAPA |  and identified problems and constraints as well as capacity-building needs for the implementation of activities and projects identified as urgent and immediate in NAPAs. The LEG provided support for the GEF consultations with LDC Parties that were held in Dhaka |  Bangladesh |  on the draft programming paper on the LDCF;8 Interacted with the NAPA teams of Bangladesh |  Maldives |  the Solomon Islands |  Tuvalu |  Uganda and Vanuatu during LEG meetings; Collaborated with other actors engaged in providing technical support to LDCs and disseminated information on financial and technical support for NAPA implementation; Identified technical needs in relation to access to |  and management of |  NAPA-related data and information |  and explored solutions with relevant actors; Cooperated with the other constituted bodies under the Convention |  in particular with the EGTT on the adaptation technology and project preparation training and with the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (CGE) on the integration of information contained in NAPAs into second national communications; Examined submitted NAPAs in order to determine the efforts made by LDCs in integrating NAPAs into development planning and national strategies for sustainable development. |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | (d) |  |  |  | (e) (f) (g) (h) |  |  |  | (i) |  |  |  | 26. In assessing progress in the implementation of its work programme for 2006–2007 and in reflecting on the information presented at the stocktaking meeting |  the LEG notes that many LDC Parties |  | 7 8 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2006/9 |  annex I. <http://www.thegef.org/Documents/Council_Documents/GEF_C28/documents/C.28.18LDCTrustFund_000.pdf>. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/31 Page 8 (almost 50 per cent of LDCs) have submitted their NAPAs and several have yet to start NAPA preparation. Most of the LDCs that have yet to submit their NAPAs expressed their intention to submit these documents in 2008. This highlights the need for continued support for NAPAs in the future. 27. In response to the issues arising from the stocktaking on NAPA preparation |  continued technical advice and support is needed for Parties that have yet to submit NAPAs. The LEG agreed that |  in accordance with the group’s mandate |  the main task would be to continue to provide technical advice to NAPA teams |  especially by reviewing the draft NAPA |  upon request. The LEG will continue |  in its review of draft NAPA documents |  to remind NAPA teams to use agreed documentation in preparing NAPAs |  including the NAPA annotated guidelines |  and UNITAR NAPA information sheets |  as applicable. 28. Based on the input and experiences shared on NAPA implementation |  the LEG also considered that |  as more NAPAs are being implemented |  there is an immediate need to provide information and guidance on project development and implementation. The need to assist LDCs in the development of a NAPA implementation strategy also remains relevant. 29. The LEG also noted that NAPA experts require more information on GEF procedures for accessing funding and suggests that the GEF secretariat prepare a user manual on how to access GEF funding for adaptation – through the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) |  LDCF and the Strategic Priority to Adaptation (SPA) – that would provide guidance to GEF focal points |  GEF agencies and NAPA teams |  and ensure a consistent approach and common understanding of the steps relating to project funding. 30. LEG outreach activities intended to further the information exchange and build capacities for LDCs to implement NAPAs were discussed. In addition |  the process of facilitating training in project preparation |  drawing upon the work of the EGTT |  had progressed |  but further work was needed to disseminate information on the project preparation process and provide training on this issue to LDC Parties. 31. The LEG also noted its continued cooperation and active involvement on adaptation issues with other expert groups (the CGE and the EGTT). Exploring additional synergies with other expert groups in this regard was discussed |  in particular |  the efforts of the CGE to provide guidance on the integration of information contained in NAPAs into the second national communications. 32. Other issues addressed that would require follow-up by the LEG for NAPA preparation and implementation included support to francophone and lusophone NAPA teams to overcome language barriers (e.g. by making information relevant to the NAPA process available in other languages and by providing interpretation services at LDC events) |  and provision of feedback on the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change. 33. The LEG also observed that resources from Parties included in Annex II to the Convention to support the work of the LEG and the NAPA process at country level have been maintained at a high level and were important for |  and instrumental in |  the implementation of the LEG work programme for 2006–2007. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/31 Page 9 Annex I |  |  |  | Members of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group as at 31 August 2007 |  | Mr. Erwin Kuenzi Mr. Shawkat Ali Mirza Mr. Karma L.

The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by its decision 29/CP.7 |  established the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) |  initially for a period of two years. Subsequently the COP extended the mandate of the group three times |  twice for a period of two years (decisions 7/CP.9 and 4/CP.11) and once for a period of three years (decision 8/CP.13). 2. The COP |  by its decision 6/CP.16 |  extended the mandate of the LEG for five more years and requested the group to develop a two-year rolling programme of work for consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) at its first sessional meeting of each year. |  |  |  | II. Summary of the nineteenth meeting of the Least Developed Country Expert Group |  | A. Proceedings |  | 3. The nineteenth meeting of the LEG was held in Blantyre |  Malawi |  from 14 to 17 March 2011. 4. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) |  two of its agencies: the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |  Africa Adaptation Programme (AAP) |  Environmental Development Action in the Third World (ENDA) |  and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) took part in the meeting. This was in line with decision 8/CP.13 of the COP |  mandating that the LEG invite |  when deemed necessary |  GEF and its agencies to its meetings |  as well as decision 6/CP.16 requesting that the LEG engage a wide range of organizations to support the implementation of the LEG work programme. 5. The meeting was opened by the Deputy Director of Environmental Affairs |  Dr. Aloysius Kampelewera |  on behalf of the Government of Malawi. He highlighted the important role played by the national adaptation programme of action (NAPA) process in Malawi in raising awareness of climate change within the government and among the public. A representative of the secretariat drew attention to the outcomes of the sixteenth session of the COP and their importance in support to the least developed countries (LDCs) |  in particular |  the extension and expansion of the mandate of the LEG. A representative of the GEF |  speaking on behalf of the GEF and its agencies |  flagged the continuing pledges to the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) by donor countries. The Chair of the LEG appreciated the presence of the various agencies at the meeting |  and hoped for a fruitful collaboration in implementing the LEG work programme. 6. During this meeting |  the LEG focused its work on the development of a work programme for the next two years as mandated by the SBI. On the interaction with the GEF and its agencies |  the LEG focused on ways to develop a strategy for addressing challenges faced by LDCs in implementing NAPAs |  and areas of collaboration in the implementation of the LDC work programme. An orientation session for new LEG members was conducted at the beginning of the meeting. |  |  |  | 3 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  |  |  | B. |  |  |  | Election of officers of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | 7. In accordance with paragraph 5 of the LEG terms of reference | 1 the LEG is to elect annually a Chair |  a Vice-Chair and two rapporteurs from among its LDC members. At this nineteenth meeting |  the group elected the following officers: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Mr. Fredrick Kossam (Malawi) |  Chair; Ms. Pepetua Election Latasi (Tuvalu) |  Vice-Chair; Mr. Batu Krishna Uprety (Nepal) |  anglophone rapporteur; Mr. Paul Abiziou Tchinguilou (Togo) |  francophone rapporteur; Mr. Abias Huongo (Angola) |  lusophone rapporteur. |  |  |  | C. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Review of the preparation and implementation of national adaptation programmes of action |  | Status of the preparation of national adaptation programmes of action 8. As at 14 March 2011 |  of the 48 LDCs that had received funding for the preparation of NAPAs |  45 had submitted NAPAs to the secretariat. The three remaining countries (Angola |  Myanmar and Timor-Leste) are yet to submit their completed NAPAs. 9. The LEG agreed to assist these LDCs that have not submitted their NAPAs |  to complete their NAPAs as soon as possible and to catch up quickly with the implementation process. To this effect |  the LEG decided to continue monitoring the progress files for each of these LDCs |  to facilitate tracking of progress |  and the identification and mitigation of any possible bottlenecks. The monitoring of progress files will also be extended to cover all the LDCs |  and to track the implementation process. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Status of national adaptation programmes of action implementation 10. The GEF reported on the NAPA projects under its consideration. As at 16 March 2011 |  23 projects had been endorsed by the Chief Executive Officer of the GEF to start implementation on the ground. In addition |  19 more projects that are beginning to apply for funding under the LDCF were approved by the GEF Council. The GEF also reported on the level of funds in the LDCF |  and indicated that the current level of pledges for the LDCF is USD 320 million. The GEF further mentioned that each LDC would now be able to access up to USD 10 million from the LDCF. The GEF encouraged the LEG to devise a strategy on how to communicate the information on funding available to the LDC Parties. 11. To date |  the following GEF agencies are currently supporting the implementation of NAPA projects in the LDCs: UNDP |  the World Bank |  the United Nations Environment Programme |  the International Fund for Agricultural Development |  the African Development Bank and FAO. 12. The LEG welcomed the progress in the implementation of NAPAs. It welcomed the improved flow of information on the status of NAPA projects under consideration by the GEF and its agencies through regular interaction with these bodies during LEG meetings |  as well as through direct communication. To improve the tracking of progress on the implementation of the NAPA projects at the country level |  the LEG decided to continue interviews with LDC/NAPA teams |  and will produce periodic summaries of progress on NAPA implementation. |  | 1 |  |  |  | Decision 29/CP.7 |  annex. |  |  |  | 4 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  |  |  | 3. |  |  |  | Emerging issues from a discussion on the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 13. During the discussions |  it was recalled that many LDC NAPA teams continue to experience problems during implementation |  such as with the application of co-financing requirements |  delays in accessing funding after projects have been approved |  limited access to information about the status of project proposals as the projects undergo review and approval |  limited feedback from some agencies that do not have country offices and access to guidance on the application of new approaches to project implementation. In addition |  it was agreed that new approaches require new and additional support |  especially programmatic approaches. 14. To overcome these problems |  the LEG decided to prioritize efforts to support LDCs in the design of implementation strategies |  as many of them have now completed their NAPAs and are actively embarking on their implementation. Such efforts would include: in the case of new approaches |  conducting case studies to showcase how these approaches can be implemented; developing guidelines and technical papers; coordinating or conducting training workshops to further enhance implementation |  introducing new approaches and incorporating integration of NAPAs into development planning and gender issues; using a platform for sharing information and lessons on the NAPAs; communicating key complementary information on issues of access to funds |  co-financing |  additionality |  and log-frames; developing and disseminating targeted outreach products; and collaborating strongly with a broad spectrum of organizations. 15. With respect to funding for implementing NAPA projects |  it was highlighted that many LDCs raise questions on how to access funds for the second and subsequent projects under the LDCF as more funds become available. Past discussions have explored different approaches |  including scaling up existing projects to reach more beneficiaries. The GEF mentioned that it is administratively simpler to submit a new project for the additional funds. The LEG will work with the GEF to develop instructions on how to access additional resources under the LDCF as more funds become available |  including options for scaling up NAPA activities. 16. Further |  in supporting LDCs identify complementary resources for the implementation of NAPAs |  the LEG decided to capture wide-ranging sources of funding of potential relevance to the NAPAs |  and to make this information available to LDC Parties. 17. The LEG agreed to compile and analyse information on the implementation of NAPAs in order to track the status of implementation for each LDC |  in cooperation with the GEF |  its agencies and other relevant actors. The LEG will assess and analyse the NAPA implementation process in order to identify measures of success and benchmarks for key steps and expected outcomes. It will further develop an approach for monitoring the effectiveness of adaptation efforts in LDCs to reduce vulnerability to climate change. |  |  |  | 4. |  |  |  | Review and update of national adaptation programmes of action 18. Two countries (Bangladesh and Senegal) had revised their NAPAs as at 14 March 2011. A number of other LDCs have also indicated that they are in the process of conducting consultations on revising their NAPAs |  noting several advantages |  such as increased levels of awareness among various stakeholders at the national level. 19. The LEG decided to prepare updated guidance on how countries can revise and update their NAPAs |  taking into account the latest developments and opportunities for longer-term adaptation planning. The LEG also decided to capture experiences and lessons learned from those countries that have updated or revised their NAPA |  and to share these with others. The LEG will also comment on draft revised or updated NAPAs |  upon request from LDC Parties. |  | 5 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  |  |  | 5. |  |  |  | Surveys 20. The LEG underscored the value of continuing to conduct surveys on the status of the preparation and implementation of NAPAs and on experiences gained by LDC Parties during the sessions of the subsidiary bodies. The feedback that LDC Parties provide through these surveys is critical in addressing obstacles that NAPA teams may be facing. These surveys would also enable collection of information on the implementation of NAPA activities in addition to information about activities funded through the GEF |  and on the implementation of the other elements of the LDC work programme. |  |  |  | D. |  |  |  | Consideration of the identification of needs and implementation of medium- and long-term adaptation activities in least developed countries |  and their integration into development planning |  | 21. The LEG discussed how it would provide technical advice and guidance to LDC Parties on identifying needs for medium- and long-term adaptation |  and subsequent implementation. The LEG noted the existence of some national adaptation plans and strategies for a range of countries |  and agreed that it would be of great value to review the methods used and their outcomes |  and to use these as a resource in elaborating on advice to LDCs. The LEG therefore decided to conduct case study reviews of existing medium- and long-term adaptation plans to identify how these can inform medium- and long-term adaptation planning and implementation in LDCs. The LEG would then develop a technical paper |  by its next meeting |  on how medium- and long-term adaptation activities can be implemented in LDCs |  taking into account processes of integrating adaptation into national development planning |  including sector-wide and programmatic approaches. Such a paper would be used as a basis for capacity-building efforts by the LEG |  including through training workshops |  in close collaboration with relevant agencies and regional centres. |  |  |  | E. |  |  |  | Consideration on the integration of gender and other considerations regarding vulnerable communities within least developed countries |  | 22. The LEG noted the importance of emphasizing |  reflecting and integrating gender considerations in the NAPAs. In the discussions |  a number of examples from various sectors were noted |  which could inform the LEG on how to best integrate gender in the NAPAs. The LEG decided to set this issue as a priority. It also decided to conduct reviews on how gender and other sources of vulnerability have been considered. This process will then lead into a technical paper |  which will be used as a basis for providing technical advice and guidance to LDCs on how to best integrate gender into their adaptation planning and implementation. |  |  |  | F. |  |  |  | Facilitating the implementation of the other elements of the least developed countries work programme |  | 23. The LEG discussed how its role in the implementation of the LDC work programme would be primarily to mobilize relevant expertise and programmes and to capitalize on synergies in support of the implementation of the work programme. As part of the immediate activities |  the LEG will prepare an options paper jointly with GEF and its agencies on how national climate change secretariats can be established and supported in accordance with LDCs existing mandates for support under the LDCF. The LEG will additionally prepare a technical paper on the role and application of technology in the implementation of NAPAs in LDCs. It will explore modalities for NAPA adaptation |  |  |  | 6 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  |  |  | projects to support national data collection and analysis |  in conjunction with the dialogue with the GEF and its agencies |  and with the NAPA teams. |  |  |  | G. |  |  |  | Cooperation with others |  | 24. The LEG is mandated to facilitate the exchange of information and to promote regional synergy |  and synergy with other multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) | 2 and to engage a wide range of organizations to support implementation of its work programme.3 25. On cooperation with the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention (CGE) |  the LEG decided that that its Chair should meet with the Chair of the CGE to discuss areas of cooperation. The LEG suggested that these could include |  but are not limited to: supporting jointly countries that have not submitted their initial national communication or NAPA in undertaking common activities such as vulnerability and adaptation assessments; collecting data and information jointly from countries (e.g. case studies |  surveys or progress monitoring); exchanging information and lessons on support to countries in performing vulnerability and adaptation assessments; exchanging work programmes and information to indentify further areas of collaboration. 26. The LEG further agreed that it would be important to develop linkages with |  and outreach to |  other bodies established under the Convention (such as the Adaptation Fund Board |  the Adaptation Committee and the Technology Executive Committee) about the LDC work programme |  in order to improve understanding and avoid policies and procedures that disadvantage LDCs’ access to other forms of support in implementing the LDC work programme. 27. The LEG also discussed the need to enhance synergies with other MEAs |  relevant organizations |  programmes and regional centres of excellence. For this |  the LEG agreed to mobilize actively the relevant organizations in the implementation of its work programme |  as well as in the implementation of the LDC work programme |  and to promote South– South and triangular cooperation. It will promote the exchange of information on case studies and lessons learned on how to achieve synergy at the regional level in implementing activities relevant to NAPAs and the LDC work programme through relevant regional workshops. 28. The LEG agreed that the LDC Portal can serve as a platform for mobilizing and engaging a wide range of organizations and institutions in supporting the implementation of the LDC and LEG work programmes. The LEG will revise the LEG guidance paper on promotion of regional synergy in the implementation of NAPAs | 4 and will include consideration of other elements of the LDC work programme. |  |  |  | H. |  |  |  | Outreach on the national adaptation programmes of action and on the work of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | 29. The LEG discussed how to best communicate the results of its work to enhance the delivery of its advice and support to LDC Parties. It agreed to update and enhance the LDC Portal and to create a platform for sharing best practices and lessons learned on the NAPA process to inform implementation of NAPAs and future activities on medium- and long2 3 4 |  |  |  | Decision 29/CP.7.

The LEG will also develop a training and outreach package for use by LDCs at the national level for the training of all stakeholders involved in the NAPA process |  focusing on NAPA implementation. In addition |  the LEG will continue to promote the exchange of information on matters relating to LDCs through side events organized during the sessions of the COP and its subsidiary bodies |  as well as through other relevant forums. |  |  |  | I. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Discussions with the Global Environment Facility and its agencies |  | Proceedings 30. The LEG held discussions with the GEF and its agencies on the third and fourth days of its meeting. The GEF secretariat |  FAO and UNDP participated in the discussions. The discussions focused on two distinct areas. Firstly |  the updates on progress made in the preparation and implementation of NAPAs |  and the implementation of all the other elements of the LDC work programme. Secondly |  the response to the request made by the SBI at its thirty-third session requesting that the LEG discuss |  with the GEF and its agencies |  ways to further improve access to funds from the LDCF |  the disbursement of funds |  the design of implementation strategies for NAPAs using a programmatic approach |  ways to best communicate co-financing requirements under the LDCF |  and the remaining challenges faced by LDC Parties in working with GEF agencies.5 |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Main issues raised 31. Regarding NAPAs |  the GEF representative highlighted that the LDCF is one of the first funds to test concrete adaptation financing on the ground. The representative mentioned that based on current contributions to the LDCF |  each LDC Party can now access up to a maximum of USD 10 million for the implementation of NAPA projects. The representative mentioned that the GEF maintains special operation of the LDCF |  and has introduced two new features for operation of the LDCF under its strategy on adaptation to climate change.6 These features represent an introduction to programmatic approaches |  and blended projects (e.g. combining LDCF funding with regular GEF focal-area funding). Futher |  the GEF representative provided information on the additional cost principle as applied under the LDCF. A question on co-financing was posed in the case of purely adaptation stand-alone projects |  and for which no baseline exists. The GEF representative mentioned that there exists an option for demonstrating stand-alone projects under the LDCF |  but further cautioned that any project would still somehow be tied to some baseline project activities. 32. Regarding the remaining elements of the LDC work programme |  the LEG brought to the attention of the meeting reiterations of the mandate of the COP to the GEF.7 The GEF representative indicated that the COP guidance is too general and vague |  and hence difficult to interpret. The GEF representative suggested that the LEG could help the GEF in interpreting the guidance with a view to finding ways on how to begin implementing it. 33. On ways to further improve access to funds from the LDCF |  the LEG clarified that the key issues from LDC Parties had been access to information on the amount of money available to each LDC |  and information regarding the operation of the LDCF given continuous changes. The representative of the GEF indicated that the GEF has developed a paper entitled Accessing Resources under the Least Developed Countries Fund | 8 which |  | 5 6 7 8 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2010/27 |  paragraph 73. <http://www.thegef.org/gef/pubs/Strategy_on_Adaptation_2011>. Decision 5/CP.16 |  paragraph 1 |  and decision 5/CP.14 |  paragraph 2. GEF/LDCF.SCCF.8/3 |  |  |  | 8 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  |  |  | provides additional simplified guidelines on accessing the LDCF. The representative indicated that the paper was currently being revised |  and that it will be made available in English |  French and Portuguese |  and will be sent to the UNFCCC focal points and any other relevant stakeholders in LDCs. 34. On the disbursement of funds |  the key issue identified was the delay in making funds available. A case in point is Malawi’s project for which implementation of the first NAPA project had not yet started eight months after endorsement by the GEF (see para. 44). UNDP also provided an example that delays are also at times due to national-level processes |  which include project signature by relevant authorities |  recruitment and training of project staff |  inception meetings |  etc. |  which take time and differ from one country to another. It was agreed that agencies should be fully aware of the processes that need to be undertaken to initiate implementation |  and that any delays should be minimized by undertaking possible activities in parallel with the GEF project-cycle process. LDC Parties should also be advised to communicate regularly with the GEF through their focal points when enquiring about the status of their projects. 35. Regarding the design of an implementation strategy for NAPAs using programmatic approaches |  it was noted that there is little experience on the ground with regard to NAPA projects. It was then proposed that the LEG could prepare a guidance paper on the programmatic approach for implementing NAPAs in collaboration with the GEF and its agencies. The paper should provide guidance on how to incorporate a programmatic approach into NAPAs; experiences from other programmes; information on how to address issues of baselines and co-financing for projects and programmes; synergies |  sector-wide approaches and integration into national planning. 36. On discussions to address the remaining challenges faced by LDC Parties in working with GEF agencies |  it was agreed that there needs to be a common understanding between the agencies and countries on the necessary steps in preparing and implementing projects |  including how to profile and track projects. It was further noted that communication between the agencies and the countries needs to be strengthened. 37. In the general concluding discussions |  it was suggested that the issues above should be integrated into the work of the LEG where possible |  including in the surveys |  technical papers |  guidelines and future training workshops. It was also agreed that the collaboration between the LEG |  the GEF and its agencies needs to be maintained in order to facilitate support to LDCs. |  |  |  | J. |  | 1. |  |  |  | Interaction with other organizations |  | Proceedings 38. In addition to the GEF and its agencies |  the LEG engaged three other organizations in the meeting |  UNITAR |  AAP and ENDA |  to discuss broader support to LDC Parties in the implementation of the LDC work programme. These organizations made brief presentations on their areas of work that would complement the implementation of the LDC work programme |  and subsequent discussions centred on creating interlinkages and enhancing collaboration in supporting LDCs. |  |  |  | 2. |  |  |  | Main issues raised 39. UNITAR highlighted activities undertaken by its climate change programme |  which included the following: translation of various climate change documents and materials into multiple languages; support to the regional NAPA preparation workshops that were |  | <http://www.thegef.org/gef/sites/thegef.org/files/documents/Accessing%20Resources..pdf>. 9 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  |  |  | conducted in 2003; a publication on a selection of examples and exercises drawn from regional NAPA preparation workshops;9 a NAPA website and interactive database for exchange of information; training for African media to improve upon the reporting on climate change that was conducted in October 2010;10 a regional workshop on climate change for the Arab States that was conducted in September 2010; as well as UNITAR’s online training platform. UNITAR identified potential areas of collaboration with the LEG to be the translation of various documentation into French and Portuguese |  and capacitybuilding for negotiators. 40. A representative of the AAP made a presentation on the programme’s support to 20 African countries on data and information management. Specific activities include support to countries for development of information management strategies |  establishment of networks and partnerships to support data and information management |  development of einfrastructure for data and information management |  and development of tools and methods for adaptation planning. 41. The ENDA representative highlighted that its programmes are primarily guided by the needs of local communities. The representative indicated that such an approach is important when developing and using tools and methodologies for addressing vulnerability issues in local communities. This should also include engagement of local people in multidisciplinary teams |  partnerships and as key players in developing and implementing demonstration projects. On potential areas of collaboration with the LEG |  the representative indicated that ENDA would be interested in contributing to the work of the LEG on issues related to community-based adaptation |  mainstreaming gender into energy and climate change |  and in low-carbon development initiatives. 42. In the discussions |  the LEG |  the GEF and its agencies |  and the three organizations agreed that further collaboration should be pursued |  especially on the implementation of the LDC work programme. |  |  |  | K. |  |  |  | Interaction between the Least Developed Countries Expert Group and the Malawi national adaptation programme of action team |  | 43. In keeping with its practice of interacting with the NAPA team of the country hosting the LEG meeting |  the LEG conducted an interactive session with representatives of the Malawi NAPA team |  and other government officials. The Malawi NAPA team provided an overview of their progress in the preparation and implementation of the NAPA. The team also provided a broad overview and vision for the climate change process in Malawi. 44. On the progress in preparing and implementing NAPA |  the team gave the following timeline: preparation of the NAPA began in May 2003 and was completed in 2005; the NAPA was officially launched by the government in February 2006; it was submitted to the UNFCCC secretariat in March 2006; a first NAPA project for funding under the LDCF was prepared and submitted to the GEF in 2006 through the African Development Bank (AfDB) as a GEF agency; the GEF changed the format for submission of projects |  and the project had to be resubmitted in the new format in April 2007; the project identification form for this project was then approved by the GEF in May 2007; development of a full-sized project was initiated in 2008 |  the full-sized project was endorsed by the GEF in August 2010 to start implementation; as at March 2011 |  the project was still with the AfDB for review to ensure its alignment with AfDB’s workplan before implementation. The project |  entitled “Climate adaptation for rural livelihoods and agriculture (CARLA)” |  will support |  | 9 10 |  |  |  | FCCC/TP/2005/4. <http://www.uneca.org/adfvii/documents/PreADF/ReportTraining-unitar.pdf>. |  |  |  | 10 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  |  |  | six communities across Malawi and will cost USD 27 million |  with USD 3 million coming from the LDCF and USD 24 million coming from other sources. 45. The Malawi team mentioned that in addition to the NAPA projects |  there are other projects being implemented with development partners that touch on the priorities identified in the NAPA |  and that have used the NAPA as a basis for their design. These projects include a sustainable land management project |  which is being implemented by the UNDP with funding from the GEF Trust Fund and the AAP | 11 and the Malawi Greenbelt Initiative Programme implemented by the Government of Malawi to use available abundant water resources for irrigation farming. The proposed CARLA project will build on these projects |  and it also became apparent from the discussions that the projects are beginning to lay the groundwork for the implementation of CARLA. Malawi concluded by providing an overview of the climate change programme |  which includes: establishment of a government–development partners task team that meets quarterly; creation of a One UN Fund for coordinated support of climate change activities; and the development of a national climate change strategy. 46. During discussions |  it was noted that the NAPA process has taken too long in Malawi; it has been eight years since the process was kickstarted to implementation of the first adaptation project on the ground. On the discussions on possible mitigation for this delay |  it was made clear that for LDCF projects |  comprehensive review of the projects is performed under the GEF project cycle |  and that agencies should coordinate their own internal review in parallel with the GEF project cycle in order to avoid delays in implementation. |  |  |  | III. Work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2011–2012 |  | 47. As requested by the COP in decision 6/CP.16 |  the LEG developed |  at its 9th meeting |  a work programme for 2011–2012 (see annex I). A detailed version of the workplan |  including specific objectives |  expected outcomes and a timeline |  is given on the UNFCCC website.12 48. In preparing the work programme (see annex I) |  the LEG focused on the key areas of support as identified in decision 6/CP.16. The LEG further noted that its ongoing efforts to fulfil its mandate as detailed in decision 29/CP.7 (annex |  para. 9 (a)–(e)) |  continue to be relevant |  and agreed to build on those efforts in developing the new work programme. 49. The LEG prioritized its work |  and decided to focus on the following activities with outputs in 2011: (a) Prepare a technical paper |  by the next LEG meeting |  on how medium- and long-term adaptation activities can be implemented in LDCs |  taking into account processes of integrating adaptation into national development planning |  including sector-wide and programmatic approaches; (b) Share experiences |  best practices and lessons learned from the LDC work programme to the fourth United Nations conference on LDCs that will take place in Istanbul |  Turkey |  in May 2011; (c) Prepare a guidance paper on a programmatic approach for implementing NAPAs |  in collaboration with the GEF and its agencies; |  |  |  | 11 12 |  |  |  | <http://www.undp.org.mw/>. <http://www.unfccc.int/5977>. 11 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  |  |  | (d) Develop a guidance paper |  based on existing material and case studies |  on how to integrate gender and considerations regarding vulnerable communities in the design and implementation of activities under the LDC work programme; (e) Develop an information note on options for accessing additional resources under the LDCF as more resources become available |  including options for scaling up NAPA activities. 50. The LEG further prioritized its work and identified the following activities to be initiated in year 1 and to be completed in year 2 and beyond: (a) Continue the dialogue with LDC NAPA teams (and other relevant stakeholders) on the NAPA and use the results to inform further LEG support |  including support for the preparation process of those LDCs yet to submit a NAPA |  and provide |  directly |  immediate advice on emerging issues as required |  in collaboration with the GEF and agencies; (b) Continue to invite the GEF and its agencies and relevant organizations and experts to LEG meetings and workshops to facilitate support to LDCs |  and communicate complementary key information to LDCs |  through regular notes |  in response to key concerns (such as |  accessing of funds |  co-financing |  adaptation-additionality and elaboration of log frames for common project activities); (c) Develop an approach for monitoring the effectiveness of adaptation efforts in LDCs to reduce vulnerability to climate change; (d) Compile and analyse information on implementation of NAPAs |  profile and track status of implementation for each LDC; (e) Develop updated guidelines for the preparation |  revision and update of NAPAs |  taking into account identified best practices and lessons learned |  and the possible application of sector-specific and programmatic approaches |  and issues of medium- and long-term adaptation; (f) Design and conduct regional training workshops to facilitate application of new approaches |  such as the programmatic approach and the integration of gender concerns in the implementation of NAPAs |  to develop human resources in support of medium and long-term adaptation activities |  as well as to address key issues related to implementation of NAPAs |  revision and update of NAPAs |  and to serve as a means of exchanging best practices and lessons learned at the regional level |  in close collaboration with relevant agencies and regional centres; (g) Prepare a technical paper on the role and application of technology in the implementation of NAPAs in LDCs; (h) Enhance the LDC Portal to serve as the main knowledge base for information on the work of the LEG and the NAPA projects and their implementation |  and use it as a platform for mobilizing and engaging a wide range of organizations and institutions in supporting the implementation of the LDC and LEG work programmes; (i) Design and implement a best practices and lessons learned platform on the LDC Portal to share information on the development and implementation of NAPAs and national adaptation plans |  common vulnerabilities in LDCs and practical solutions at different scales |  role and application of technology in NAPAs |  and on approaches to promote synergy (regional |  between sectors and between multilateral environmental agreements); (j) Prepare papers on approaches to implement the remaining elements of the LDC work programme |  such as on how national climate change secretariats can be |  |  |  | 12 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  |  |  | established and supported in LDCs according to existing mandates for support under the LDCF |  and on modalities for NAPA adaptation projects to support national data collection and analysis |  as part of the dialogue with the GEF and agencies |  NAPA teams and other relevant organizations and centres. 51. The LEG further considered that closer collaboration with the GEF and its agencies will continue to be important in implementing the LEG work programme. |  |  |  | 13 |  |  |  | 14 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2011/4 |  |  |  | Annex Ia |  | Work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2011–2012 |  | Work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2011–2012 |  | Mandates Overall objective Main activities Expected outcomes |  |  |  | Decision 29/CP.7 |  annex |  paragraph 9 (a) |  decision 4/CP.11 |  paragraph 2.

In response to an offer by the Government of Yemen |  the thirteenth meeting of the group was held in Sana’a |  Yemen |  from 14 to 16 April 2008. As this was the first meeting of the group in its fourth term |  the proceedings focused on developing a comprehensive work programme for the period 2008–2010 |  as requested by decision 8/CP.13. The work programme contains objectives |  activities and expected outcomes |  and takes into account the results of a stocktaking meeting on NAPAs held in 2007 and the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change. The meeting also resulted in the election of new officers. Upon an initiative by the focal point of Yemen |  the LEG also devoted a session to interacting with Yemen’s NAPA team |  which had recently prepared its draft NAPA. Both the LEG and the NAPA team benefited from questions and feedback during this interaction. |  |  |  | * |  |  |  | This document was submitted after the due date as a result of the timing of the meeting. |  |  |  | GE.08-61416 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/6 Page 2 CONTENTS |  |  |  | Paragraphs I.

Mandate |  | 1. The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by its decision 29/CP.7 |  established the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) |  initially for a period of two years. Subsequently the COP extended the mandate of the group twice |  each time for a period of two years (decisions 7/CP.9 and 4/CP.11). 2. The COP |  by its decision 8/CP.13 |  extended the mandate of the LEG for three more years and requested the group to develop a work programme that contains its objectives |  activities and expected outcomes |  and takes into account the results of a stocktaking meeting1 on national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) held in September 2007 and the Nairobi work programme on impacts |  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change |  for consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Implementation at its twenty-eighth session. |  |  |  | II. Summary of the thirteenth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | A. Proceedings 3. The Minister of Water and Environment of Yemen |  His Excellency Mr. Abdul-Rahman Al-Eryani |  opened and closed the LEG meeting. In his opening remarks |  he highlighted the importance of the NAPA in advancing adaptation planning for Yemen and the need for effective implementation immediately upon completion of the preparation phase. A representative of the secretariat gave an overview of NAPAs and how they have served as useful mechanisms for least developed countries (LDCs) to communicate their urgent and immediate vulnerabilities to climate change |  and resulted in national capacity being built for adaptation to climate change during the preparation and implementation of NAPAs. She underscored the important role that NAPAs are playing in serving as a first step in national adaptation efforts in LDCs. In his remarks |  the Chair of the LEG |  Mr. Bubu Jallow |  highlighted the main achievements of the LEG in supporting LDCs since the establishment of the LEG in 2001 |  and expressed full support of the LEG to the Yemeni NAPA team and other teams as they finalize their NAPAs and prepare to implement priority activities. B. Election of officers of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group 4. In accordance with paragraph 5 of the LEG terms of reference | 2 the LEG is to elect annually a Chair |  a Vice-Chair and two rapporteurs from among its LDC members. At its thirteenth meeting the group elected the following officers: (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Mr. Bubu Jallow (Gambia) |  Chair Mr. Mohamed Shareef (Maldives) |  Vice-Chair Mr. Djibril Ibila (Benin) |  francophone Rapporteur Mr. Adérito Manuel Fernandes Santana (Sao Tome and Principe) |  lusophone Rapporteur Mr. Benjamin Karmorh (Liberia) |  anglophone Rapporteur. |  |  |  | 1 2 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2007/32.

Status of national adaptation programme of action preparation and additional guidance 5. In reviewing the status of NAPA implementation |  the LEG welcomed the 32 NAPAs that were submitted to the secretariat by 14 April 2008. As a result of the interaction of the LEG with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and its agencies |  several countries are at an advanced stage of preparation and many of them expect to submit their NAPAs during 2008. Some countries are about to start the preparation process |  and a few have not submitted a proposal for funding for the preparation phase because of political difficulties in their countries. 6. The LEG noted concerns by some LDC Parties about difficulties faced during the preparation phase |  such as technical difficulties in finalizing proposals for funding for the preparation of NAPAs |  and the length of time taken to gain GEF approval and to access funds for the preparation through the GEF agencies. The LEG also noted |  with concern |  the gradual reduction in efforts to assist countries to prepare NAPAs |  as emphasis shifts towards the implementation of completed NAPAs. 7. The LEG took note of the rich feedback on the NAPA preparation process received during the 2007 stocktaking meeting and the many areas in which Parties would benefit from additional guidance and capacity-building. The LEG reviewed the guidelines for the preparation of NAPAs | 3 including the LEG annotations | 4 and noted several areas that require further elaboration |  to take into account lessons learned and changes that have been introduced by the GEF in the processing of proposals for funding. In particular |  the LEG noted the need to enhance its advice to Parties |  still in the preparation phase |  to modify the format and content of project profiles in order to better address requirements for the preparation of project information forms (PIFs) which are submitted to the GEF. Previous project profiles were based on project development format A (PDF-A) as described in the 2001 NAPA guidelines. 8. The LEG noted with satisfaction the degree of integration of NAPAs and NAPA priorities in national development plans and activities. To improve how this integration is reported in NAPAs |  the LEG recommended additional annotation to the guidelines |  so that countries can show clearly how the integration was achieved |  and how NAPA activities are aligned with activities and projects proposed under national development plans such as the poverty reduction strategies. 9. The LEG noted that additional guidance on the preparation of NAPAs is urgently needed to assist countries that are facing particular difficulties to complete their NAPAs as soon as possible |  so that they can implement activities in a timely fashion. 2. Synthesis and analysis of completed national adaptation programmes of action 10. A synthesis of completed NAPAs that were presented during the 2007 stocktaking meeting provided the basis for analysis of the NAPA process. The LEG used the analysis to discuss concerns raised on completed NAPAs |  for example that some NAPAs are not adequately mainstreamed into national development and that they do not involve stakeholders from multiple sectors and disciplines. As more Parties complete their NAPAs |  further analysis will provide additional information and useful lessons. 11. The LEG discussed the appropriate use of information presented in NAPAs |  and indicated that the information on the costs of activities as contained in project profiles of NAPAs should be used as a |  | 3 4 |  |  |  | Decision 28/CP.7 |  annex. “Annotated guidelines for NAPA preparation” |  <http://unfccc.int/files/cooperation_and_support/ldc/application/pdf/annguide.pdf>. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/6 Page 5 guide only |  and not as an accurate assessment of costs of adaptation for LDCs. The LEG recalled how NAPAs only identify urgent and immediate adaptation needs |  but do not elaborate comprehensive adaptation plans for the country. The LEG welcomed efforts by LDC Parties to conduct their preparation phase taking into account methods that best suit their local conditions. To this end |  the LEG would like to caution users of NAPA documents not to assess NAPA preparation solely against the NAPA guidelines. At the same time |  the LEG welcomes comprehensive reporting of all important steps of NAPA preparation |  especially the degree of multiple stakeholder involvement and alignment of NAPA activities to national development priorities. The LEG noted the value of the information collected during NAPA preparation for subsequent assessments |  and encourages LDC Parties to take necessary steps to consolidate this information for use in future assessments such as for the preparation of national communications. D. Consideration of the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 1. Status of implementation of national adaptation programmes of action 12. The LEG reviewed the status of implementation of NAPAs based on inputs provided by the GEF secretariat |  and noted the 16 projects under consideration by the GEF. One project for Bhutan was approved in March 2008 for full implementation. 2. Development of an implementation strategy 13. Some LDC Parties are actively developing strategies to fund NAPAs using multiple sources |  including bilateral sources |  as well as through donor-coordinated efforts at the national level through direct budget support or sector-wide approaches. During the stocktaking meeting in 2007 the LEG had taken note of requests for it to develop guidance on implementation of NAPAs |  to assist NAPA teams to navigate information requirements in preparing project proposals for funding by the GEF and other sources |  and to provide easily accessible answers to common questions about technical aspects of project development. As a result |  the LEG proposed that a step-by-step guide for the implementation of NAPAs be developed |  taking into account the latest developments in project development under the GEF and other sources of funding. The LEG further noted the urgency with which this guide should be developed and used in capacity-building efforts with NAPA teams as they begin implementation. 3. Periodic review of risks and prioritization of activities 14. The LEG noted that it may be necessary for LDCs to carry out the step of periodically reviewing risks and prioritizing activities |  as shown on page 31 of the “Annotated guidelines for NAPA preparation” |  given the time it takes to start the implementation phase after a NAPA is submitted. Such a reality check when NAPAs are |  say |  one year old or more |  would ensure that countries are addressing the most urgent and immediate needs during the implementation phase. 4. Surveys 15. The LEG underscored the value of continuing to conduct surveys on the status of |  and experiences during |  NAPA preparation |  and on the status of implementation of NAPAs |  during the sessions of the subsidiary bodies. The feedback that LDC Parties provide through these surveys is critical in addressing obstacles that NAPA teams may be facing. These surveys would also enable information to be collected about implementation of NAPA activities |  in addition to information about activities funded through the GEF. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2008/6 Page 6 5. Resources and capacity-building to support design of an implementation strategy 16. The 2007 stocktaking meeting highlighted the difficulties that LDCs are facing in developing project proposals and in designing effective implementation strategies for their NAPAs. The LEG discussed options for building the capacity of NAPA teams in order to assist LDCs in overcoming these problems. Lessons learned by those countries that have successfully submitted proposals for funding would be a useful resource. E. Interaction between the Least Developed Countries Expert Group and the Yemeni national adaptation programme of action team 17. In keeping with its practice of interacting with NAPA teams of the meeting’s host country |  the LEG conducted an interactive session with representatives of the Yemeni NAPA team. 18. The Yemeni NAPA team reported its completion of a draft of its NAPA |  which it submitted to the LEG for comments immediately after the meeting. The team presented the LEG with its main findings |  and reported on the detailed steps used for the water |  agriculture and coastal systems |  on prioritization of activities |  and on identifying urgent and immediate projects for implementation. It detailed the extensive national consultations that were held on gender and language issues and on the scope of involvement of national experts and their related agencies in the preparation of the NAPA. The NAPA team faced particular difficulties with the translation of many documents that were used in the NAPA preparation |  and noted the need to translate the whole NAPA document into Arabic for dissemination to stakeholders at the national level. The need to explain local perceptions of climate change in scientific terms was noted |  because many local communities are experiencing changes in climate that they cannot fully explain. 19. The NAPA team found the responses and coping strategies of local communities to be valuable and useful in the design of activities to be included in the draft NAPA. The team also explained its efforts to mainstream the NAPA activities into broader national planning. LEG members commented on the value of sharing lessons learned by different NAPA teams with those countries that are starting to prepare their NAPAs. 20. The Yemeni NAPA team explained that it expects implementation to proceed swiftly |  and information provided by the GEF indicates that two PIFs for implementation have already been submitted. |  |  |  | III. Work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2008–2010 |  | 21. In preparing its work programme (see annex I) |  the LEG noted that its ongoing efforts to fulfil its mandate |  as detailed in decision 29/CP.7 |  annex |  paragraph 9 (a)–(e) |  continue to be relevant and will serve as the principal means of supporting NAPA implementation. 22. The LEG considered it essential to keep under review the activities detailed in its mandate |  based on NAPAs submitted and drafts of NAPAs referred to it for comments. It considered that it has a continuing need to provide technical guidance and advice on the preparation of NAPAs |  to advise on capacity-building |  to facilitate the exchange of information and to advise on efforts to mainstream adaptation into development planning. It also recognized that the bulk of its work over the next three years will be in providing advice and capacity-building on NAPA implementation. 23. The LEG also considered that closer collaboration with the GEF and its agencies will continue to be important in the NAPA preparation and implementation phases |  because technical and institutional constraints on NAPA preparation and implementation continue to arise. |  |  |  | Annex I |  |  |  | Work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group for 2008–2010 |  | Mandate Decision 29/CP.7 |  annex |  paragraph 9 (a).

Mandate |  | 1. The Conference of the Parties (COP) |  by its decision 29/CP.7 |  established the Least Developed Countries Expert Group (LEG) to advise on the preparation and implementation strategy for national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs) |  and adopted the terms of reference of the LEG. According to these terms of reference |  the LEG is to convene its meeting twice each year |  and report on its work to the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI). 2. By its decision 4/CP.11 |  the COP decided to extend the mandate of the LEG under its original terms of reference and to review the progress |  need for continuation and terms of reference of the group |  and to adopt a decision thereon |  at its thirteenth session (December 2007). 3. As requested by decision 4/CP.11 |  the LEG developed |  at its ninth meeting |  a work programme for 2006–2007 | 1 which was considered by the SBI at its twenty-fourth session. The SBI expressed its appreciation to the LEG for its good work and welcomed the work programme it had developed. The LEG was requested to keep the SBI informed of its efforts to implement the work programme over the biennium 2006–2007 |  in accordance with its mandate |  by including in its subsequent reports information on expected outcomes. |  |  |  | II. Summary of the tenth meeting of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group |  | 4. The tenth meeting of the LEG was hosted by the Government of Uganda and held in Kampala |  Uganda |  from 4 to 6 September 2006. The Governments of Belgium |  Canada |  Ireland |  New Zealand and Norway provided financial support for the meeting. 5. As requested by decision 4/CP.11 and by the SBI |  at its twenty-fourth session (FCCC/SBI/2006/11 |  paragraphs 74−77) |  the LEG continued its efforts to implement its work programme in accordance with its mandate. Its tenth meeting focused on reviewing the NAPA preparation and implementation process; considering efforts that support Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in the preparation of NAPAs; elaborating further activities in support of the implementation of its work programme; and interacting with the NAPA team of Uganda. A. Review of national adaptation programmes of action preparation 1. Status of NAPA preparation 6. The LEG was advised that |  as at 31 August 2006 |  44 NAPA proposals have been approved for funding by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Of this number |  six have been completed and submitted to the UNFCCC secretariat. Niger submitted its NAPA in July. 7. Among LDC Parties that are in the process of preparing their NAPAs |  seven have submitted their draft NAPAs to the LEG for comments |  in accordance with paragraph 9 of the annex to decision 29/CP.7. The status of preparation of several NAPAs could not easily be determined from the information available to the LEG. It was noted that several of the LDC Parties |  especially those which only recently emerged from conflict |  are overcoming barriers to start their NAPA preparation. 8. The LEG concluded that there was a need to update its database of information on the status of NAPA preparation as well as its list of experts to assist NAPA teams |  available on the UNFCCC website at: <http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/ldc/items/3541.php>. |  |  |  | 1 |  |  |  | Annex I of document FCCC/SBI/2006/9. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2006/23 Page 4 9. The LEG agreed to develop a survey to collect |  at COP 12 |  information on the status of NAPA preparation from LDC Parties and from the implementing agencies of the GEF. It also agreed to communicate information more widely to NAPA teams of its availability |  upon request |  to assist in providing technical feedback on draft NAPAs. 2. LEG comments on draft NAPAs 10. In accordance with decision 29/CP.7 |  annex |  paragraph 9 (a) |  the LEG was requested to provide comments on the draft NAPAs of Haiti |  Madagascar |  Rwanda |  Senegal |  the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda. 11. The compiled comments made by LEG members |  input from implementing agencies and other invited comments on the draft NAPAs were discussed. The LEG noted that the NAPAs submitted for comments were of a high quality and followed the NAPA guidelines |  often exceeding the reporting requirements by |  for example |  providing detailed biogeographical data on the country. It was also noted that project profiles were presented in varying levels of detail |  and several NAPAs presented an implementation strategy for the prioritized projects proposed for implementation. 12. The LEG discussed the compiled comments and agreed to release them to the NAPA teams and to advise the respective implementing agencies of its comments. Initiatives by the LEG to facilitate and further improve the timeliness of responding to draft NAPAs were also discussed and agreed. These initiatives include developing a template to assist the LEG in providing standardized responses and monitoring the submission and response process in order to improve the LEG’s responsiveness. B. Consideration of efforts to facilitate preparation of the national adaptation programmes of action 13. The LEG was advised of the discussions at SBI 24 between the Chair of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group and representatives of the implementing agencies of the GEF |  the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) |  with technical support from the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR) |  to assist Parties in the NAPA process |  to address the capacity-building needs for NAPAs and to further facilitate support provided for the development of project proposals for funding. The discussion on capacitybuilding was targeted at two groups |  namely |  Parties that are well advanced in the process and Parties that have started the NAPA process. 1. Parties that are well advanced in the NAPA process 14. The LEG was advised that UNITAR |  taking advantage of the planned tenth meeting of the LEG |  with technical support from UNEP and UNDP |  scheduled two training workshops for anglophone African LDCs that are well advanced in the NAPA process |  but have not yet finalized the NAPA reports for endorsement by their national authorities. 15. The secretariat reported on the two training workshops which were held in Kampala |  Uganda |  from 23–26 August 2006 and in Nairobi |  Kenya |  from 30 August to 2 September 2006 |  prior to the tenth LEG meeting. The main objective of these meetings was to provide hands-on training to assist LDCs from Eastern and Southern Africa to finalize their NAPA documents |  mainly by strengthening the collection and use of climate change and socio-economic data in these documents |  especially for the project profiles. Ethiopia |  Gambia |  Lesotho |  Liberia |  Mozambique |  Sudan |  Uganda |  the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia were represented at the workshops. 16. The LEG received a communication from the participants that attended the Workshop to Support NAPAs in Anglophone African Countries in Nairobi requesting it to provide more guidance and support. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2006/23 Page 5 The workshop participants had made extensive use of the NAPA annotated guidelines |  which led them to conclude that further assistance was needed in developing project profiles |  especially in order to present the information in greater detail. 17. Additional NAPA training workshops for Parties that are well advanced in the process are planned to take place by the end of 2006 or in early 2007 |  subject to the availability of resources. 2. Parties that have started the NAPA process 18. The LEG was also advised of the efforts of UNITAR in discussions with the Chair of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group to conduct a NAPA preparation workshop for LDCs in the Asia region with the support of the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID). This training workshop is planned for late 2006 or early 2007 and is designed to assist LDCs in the Asia region that have started the NAPA preparation and are in need of technical advice and guidance in order to progress further. 19. The LEG also discussed and agreed that for the Asia region the use of national experts from countries that are well advanced |  or that had completed their NAPAs |  could provide practical experience on the NAPA process and improve the sharing of information between countries in the region. 20. The LEG concluded that the participation of its members in this effort is to be encouraged with the objective |  among others |  of receiving feedback from the NAPA teams on technical constraints in the NAPA process. C. Consideration of the work programme of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group and its expected outcomes 21. The work programme of the LEG as contained in annex 1 to document FCCC/SBI/2006/9 |  as well as the SBI 24 conclusions contained in document FCCC/SBI/2006/11 |  was further considered by the LEG at its tenth meeting. 1. Further elaboration of the LEG work programme |  2006–2007 22. Activities and related actions in the work programme were further elaborated and the members who would implement the activities identified. In organizing the work |  the members established five task teams |  based on paragraphs 9 (a) to (e) of the annex to decision 29/CP.7 |  led by a LEG member to coordinate efforts to implement the mandate. 23. In organizing itself to complete its work programme |  the LEG will focus on the NAPAs submitted to the secretariat. To achieve its expected outcomes |  the group has identified the following actions to guide its work between its tenth and eleventh meetings: (a) Develop a template for use in the narrative section of completed NAPAs in order to synthesize information on the use of the NAPA guidelines contained in the annex to decision 28/CP.7; Compile information from the template above |  on prioritized projects contained in the project profiles in completed NAPAs; Develop a questionnaire to obtain updated information from NAPA teams and the implementing agencies on technical constraints being encountered in the preparation of NAPAs; |  |  |  | (b) (c) |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2006/23 Page 6 (d) (e) (f) Extract from the questionnaire information on financial and technical needs and support that can assist NAPA implementation; Extract information on efforts aimed at mainstreaming NAPAs into development planning; Identify best practices from adaptation that could support implementation. |  |  |  | 24. To complement the above activities |  the LEG plans to invite LDC Parties to a stocktaking meeting for NAPA preparation and implementation. The main objectives would be to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the status of the NAPA preparation; to facilitate the sharing of experiences in NAPA preparation and implementation; to identify best practices in NAPA preparation; and to guide project implementation and to consider how best to mainstream NAPA activities into national development planning. 2. Implementation of the LEG work programme |  2006–2007: Expected outcomes 25. In responding to the request from the SBI |  at its twenty-fourth session | 2 the LEG further detailed its workplan by identifying the following expected outcomes from its activities: (a) Status of NAPA preparation: actions and activities identified will enable the LEG to monitor the NAPA preparation process and provide the appropriate responses to Parties in need of assistance; Comments on draft NAPAs: in addition to continuing its practice of consulting and interacting with NAPA teams of LDC Parties that are the hosts of its mandated meetings |  the LEG has provided technical feedback to Haiti |  Kiribati |  Madagascar |  Rwanda |  Senegal |  the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda. The LEG anticipates that by communicating directly with national NAPA teams its actions will provide the input that would assist the teams in finalizing the draft NAPAs for submission to the respective authorities and ultimately to the UNFCCC secretariat; NAPA preparation and implementation: by maintaining oversight of the activities of the GEF’s implementing agencies providing capacity-building with assistance from UNITAR |  the LEG expects to provide input to these activities being undertaken |  coordinating its efforts to support the activities and to provide through its membership a vital link between the agencies and the LEG activities in order to monitor both the financial and technical support being provided to LDCs in the NAPA process. It also expects |  based on the interaction between and among the various actors |  to identify and respond to any gaps in support and identify technical needs that may emerge from LDCs between them and the various actors. |  |  |  | (b) |  |  |  | (c) |  |  |  | 26. The LEG also agreed to continue interacting with LDC Parties |  implementing agencies and other relevant actors in the NAPA process in order to better advise on the issues of implementation |  to identify best practices that have been reported by LDCs as a result of national efforts to prepare NAPAs |  to share experiences in mainstreaming of NAPAs into national development planning and to formulate a response to possible means of incorporating NAPA results into national communications of LDCs. |  |  |  | 2 |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2006/11. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2006/23 Page 7 D. Interaction of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group with Uganda’s national adaptation programme of action team 27. In conjunction with its tenth meeting |  and in keeping with the past practice of interacting with NAPA teams of the host country |  the LEG conducted an interactive session with representatives of the Uganda NAPA team. 28. The Uganda NAPA team noted that it was in the final stages of NAPA preparation and that the final draft had been sent to the LEG for comments. The team briefed the LEG on its main findings. 29. The Uganda NAPA team presented an overview of the NAPA process |  its institutional arrangements and stakeholder consultations. The presentation focused on the challenges that emerged from the national exercise. They indicated that some of these challenges were: how to capture the wealth of undocumented information available at the local and regional levels; how to deal with the raised expectations of stakeholders |  as a result of the consultations and the fear that the expectations might not be realized; how to solve the problem of demarcating ecosystems across Uganda; how to resolve the difficulty in determining what should be the focus of attention in each area; and how to address the extreme difficulty in shortlisting prioritized activities for implementation across the needs identified by the NAPA study. 30. The LEG was also advised that |  on the basis of the recent workshop held in Kenya |  the Uganda NAPA team concluded that there is a need for them to re-examine the NAPA project profiles contained in the draft submitted to the LEG in an attempt to improve the presentation of information. |  |  |  | FCCC/SBI/2006/23 Page 8 Annex |  |  |  | Members of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group as at 31 August 2006 |  | Mr. Erwin Kuenzi Mr. Mahmood H.
