Rangelands are vital to the Afghan economy since they support livestock production and related industries and provide natural products such as fruits and nuts. With the enhanced resilience of ecosystems, climate change induced changes and extreme events are likely to be more gradual and less severe than under a ‘business as usual’ scenario.

LDCF funds will be used by the Government of Lao PDR to address these barriers through 3 components. Capacity building measures for climate sensitive planning targeting sub-district, district and provincial decision makers and planners will demonstrate the features and advantages of integrated ecosystems management and climate resilient physical infrastructure solutions. Socially inclusive tools of project identification will ensure that the different vulnerabilities of target populations in a changing climate are tackled and climate sensitive district budgets are elaborated and their execution monitored. This newly acquired expertise will facilitate the delivery of grants to implement climate resilient small scale infrastructure, benefitting 50,000 people, linked to the well-established UNDP/UNCDF supported block grant mechanisms (District Development Fund). This will further strengthen local governance and administrative systems for better planning, budgeting and implementation services. Environmental sustainability and project integration will be achieved through measures to protect ecosystem functions in the immediate vicinity of physical infrastructure  covering 60,000 hectares, enhancing  capacities to regulate water flows and ensuring greater financial viability and social impact overall.</p>\n",

      "summary": "<p>The Cuvelai Basin has experienced regular flooding for centuries; however over the past three hydrological years (2008-2011) the Basin has had extensive floodings with various negative repercussions, including loss of life and property. According to the Angola Civil Protection Commission, at least 234 persons were killed, 204,000 displaced and 254,000 directly affected by flooding between January and April 2011 throughout Angola. The Cuvelai Basin region was especially impacted. Heavy rainfall made access to communities difficult, with some areas only reachable by air.  At the same time, many years in the Basin are extremely dry. Almost all rain falls in the summer months and the further south in the Basin the more unpredictable the rainfall; this is typically the area where the most extreme droughts occur. The driest among these in recorded history have led to catastrophic famines, the most disastrous of which resulted in the deaths of up to 40% of the people in the Basin.  Moreover the timing of summer rainfall within one summer may be so erratic that crops fail, even if the total aggregate amount of rainfall received is high.</p>\n<p>The activities in this project are solely focused on the Angolan side of the Basin. Namibia started its basic monitoring systems (and disaster early warning systems) in the 1940s and is one of the countries in SADC that has a wide range of monitoring data available. The Namibian Hydrology Division in the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) continuously monitors the stream flow on the major rivers in Namibia, including those within the Cunene River Basin; it has river water level stations in operation at Ruacana and Epupa on the Cunene River; and operates river gauging stations (Ombuku, Minimahoro) on the ephemeral tributaries of the Lower Cunene River. Whereas almost every homestead in the Namibian side of the Basin can be reached along roads or tracks that are clearly visible on Google Earth images, the same images show that most homesteads on the Angolan Cuvelai have never or seldom been visited by vehicles. Moreover the great majority of livelihoods in the Angolan side are subsistence-oriented and dependent on rain‐fed agriculture whereas the Namibian inhabitants of the basin are much less vulnerable to climate-induced shocks.</p>\n",

This will result in decreasing security in terms of livelihoods, food and water, affecting rural development in NTT. Rural communities in NTT are highly dependent on the climate for their subsistence agricultural production and water resources. Ensuring food and water security is already a major challenge. Underlying causes of the problem include 1) Systemic vulnerabilities are high due to geographical and geophysical factors (remote and archipelagic area, with a naturally high climate variability); 2) Slow development progress in NTT (e.g. short term planning, reactive responses to problems, poor infrastructure and communication network); 3) Decentralization challenges (e.g. ineffective coordination, little attention to capacity development for sub-national institutions, 4) Community challenges such as low education levels, cultural perspectives on adopting new approaches and practices.</p>\n<p>The project will focus on strengthening and developing climate resilient institutions and rural communities centred around livelihoods, food and water security. In particular, it will support the following long-term solution: 1) Local government (including both provincial and district governments) has integrated climate resilience principles in policy, planning and budgeting, and have the institutional capacity to develop, implement and monitor this; and 2) Communities will strengthen and diversify their livelihoods in anticipation of further changes in the climate and its impacts. Identified barriers that local government and the communities are facing to improve livelihoods, food security and water security in a changing climate include informational, policy, financial, individual, and institutional barriers, with gender cutting across these.</p>\n",

Along with the rest of the Guatemala and other countries in Central America, the communities are still coping with damages from Hurricane Stan that have affected infrastructure, crops and water resources.  With the continuous climate change impacts, the communities need to learn sustainable adaptive solutions to make them, and the ecosystems they rely on, resilient.</p>\n<p>This <strong>Community-Based Adaptation</strong> project aims to reduce the community’s vulnerability to climate change through awareness-raising and capacity building workshops.

Located in the highlands of Guatemala’s San Marcos department, the communities’ lands were completely destroyed. To cope with the damages, the community members started planting tree nurseries using their own money. However, climate change variabilities such as torrential storms with strong winds, higher temperatures, longer summer seasons with prolonged periods of droughts and occasional frosts exacerbate the soil erosion and water shortage in the area, increasing the occurrence of landslides. These lead to loss of agricultural production of basic grains and threaten the food security of the community members who locally produce 70-80% of the food they consume. In addition to relying on agriculture for subsistence, the community members also rely on agriculture for income generation.</p>\n<p>In this regard, this <strong>Community-Based Adaptation</strong> project enhances the communities’ on-going activities by building nurseries to produce 35,000 trees of native species such as pine, alder, oak and cypress.  Using a participatory approach, knowledge-raising and capacity-building workshops are given to the community members on climate change, its impacts and the adaptive solutions including:  reforestation, soil conservation techniques, crop management and revitalizing other native species such as potatoes and beans.  Terracing, using stones, and other techniques to help lessen the damages of landslides are also covered.</p>\n",

Finally, the project will help these mechanisms provide support to five pilot districts, in order to build national level capacity to support districts.

In addition, the analysis indicated that monitoring, evaluation and reporting represents a cause for a number of these other constraints. Without effective monitoring, evaluation and reporting, the development of integrated national policies cannot take place adequately, even if the necessary capacity developments for policy and strategy formulation were addressed. Addressing the issue of environmental monitoring, evaluation and reporting is a necessity not only for its own sake, but also for the other identified constraints which can be considered as directly dependent on it</p>\n<p>Thus the main objective of this project is to strengthen monitoring, evaluation and reporting for Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) in Egypt, in order to promote the mainstreaming of Global Environment in national plans and policies. The project aims to accomplish this by 1) improving data management (including acquisition, processing, exchange and utilization); 2) delineating the monitoring and reporting roles and responsibilities of different concerned entities; 3) ensuring the financial sustainability for environmental monitoring, evaluation and reporting. This project will focus on the three Rio conventions (UNCBD, UNFCCC and UNCCD) in coordination with the overall environmental monitoring and reporting mechanisms in Egypt. </p>\n",

In the last decade alone the population grew by approximately 70%, one of the fastest rates in the world. With limited natural resources, the increase of population in an economy dependent upon agriculture, specifically cocoa, creates pressures for clearing vital forest in order to expand crops and habitable land. </p>\n<p>To view progress on São Tomé and Príncipe's SNC click <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/national_reports/non-annex_i_natcom/items/2979.php\">here</a>.</p>\n",

In the future, adaptation program may need to build upon current efforts related to coastal zone management, agriculture, freshwater supply, and the gender dimensions of climate change impacts. It may also need to focus on areas in which action does not seem to be on-going, such as the impacts of climate change on marine resources, human settlements and human health.

In the 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction, the Philippines was ranked eighth in the world with respect to the absolute number of people exposed to floods per year. The same report ranked the Philippines tenth on the Mortality Risk Index for landslides. The Philippines is also vulnerable to earthquakes—experiencing an average of 887 each year —and volcanic eruptions—with 20 of 220 volcanos within the archipelago being active.

PNG has already been buffeted by extreme weather and climate events such as those brought about by the El Nino in 1997/98 with further changes in temperatures and sea level rise predicted over the next 100 years. These events will lead to inundation of low lying inland and coastal areas, including the atoll islands, bleaching and loss of coastal defences.

These glaciers form an important function by retaining water, controlling flows and regulating the climate. Glaciers and permafrost are the main source of water recharging the Aral Sea river basins. In Tajikistan’s Second National Communication it is noted snow and glaciers contribute several cubic kilometres of freshwater to the main river basins in Tajikistan. Already, the country has lost more than 20 billion cubic meters of the glaciers’ ice volume (i.e., about 2.5 percent, mostly affecting small glaciers) during the twentieth century; a further increase in temperature will accelerate glacial retreat. Rainfall tends to be sporadic and in recent years (e.g., from 1999 to 2002) most precipitation has occurred in the winter and spring, causing droughts during main agricultural seasons. On the other hand, in 2007-2008, the area experienced extreme cold winter (the coldest since 1969) with increasing demand for electricity. This, coupled with high prices for food and fuel, led to the so-called 2008 Central Asia energy crisis.</p>\n",

      "summary": "<p>Aquaculture is the main activity and source of income for the 8,264 residents of Viet Nam’s Hoang Chau community. The nearby Truong Islet plays a key role in the aquaculture development of the region, as it prevents ocean waves and winds from reaching Hoang Chau Commune and its small mangrove forest area, which helps to preserve local biodiversity. Due to climate change impacts, including saltwater intrusion from strong winds and high waves brought upon by global warming, the region’s ecosystem is very fragile.  Local shrimp banks are constantly affected by the sea (winds, waves and salt contamination) and inland factors (water pollution from Ma River headwater and human activities). All these factors are destroying sea dykes, and the cost of reinforcing the degraded dyke is high. Since the 1970s, limited financial capacities have prevented shrimp farming methods from evolving, and they remain highly dependent on climate conditions. Climatic impacts have led to a reliance on natural resources, resulting in their overexploitation. To face these challenges, the local community is looking for appropriate production models that can adapt to extreme climate change.</p>\n<p>This <strong>Community-Based Adaptation </strong>project aims to promote sustainable fisheries development by testing climate change adaptation models in aquaculture and fishing. Thanh Hoa Fisheries Association initiated the project after extensive discussions with local residents through a participatory process actively involving the Hoang Chau community. The project aims at testing climate change adaptation models in aquaculture and fishing for sustainable fisheries development in Truong Islet, a brackish water region in Thanh Hoa Province and Hoang Chau Commune.</p>\n<p>* <em>This project is part of Viet Nam's <a href=\"http://www.undp-alm.org/projects/spa-community-based-adaptation-viet-nam\"><strong>Community-Based Adaptation portfolio</strong><strong>.</strong></a> *</em></p>\n",

This road's poor state increases flooding due to the absence of a drainage system. Flooding leads to salinization in the wetland ecosystem, which adversely affects the natural environment. Additionally, the Lelepa community has weak coastal hazard defenses and frequently-disrupted water accessibility due to cyclones and major flooding events.</p>\n<p><strong>This Community-Based Adaptation project</strong> increases the Lelepa village's resiliency to climate change by upgrading the inland work road, including raising the road section at the wetland crossing by installing proper drains and culverts at the wetland. A replanting strategy will be implemented with suitable plant species to reduce vulnerabilities to projected future exacerbated flooding. The barrier provided by plants will protect people's land use needs (such as farmland) and diminish salinization. The restoration of coastal defenses will be achieved via vegetation planting, which is to serve as a structural protective wall for the local village spring.</p>\n<p>* <i>This project is part of UNDP's <a href=\"http://www.undp-alm.org/projects/spa-community-based-adaptation-samoa\"><strong>\"Community-Based Adaptation\" portfolio</strong></a>.</i> *</p>\n",

Under climate change, the village is experiencing an increase in average temperatures and heat waves, intensified drought periods, and increased frequency and unpredictability of extreme rainfalls.

Agroforestry techniques will be introduced to improve resource management and maximize scarce water resources.

For Mozambique, the implementation of this project will enhance food security and the capacity to adapt to climate change in agricultural and pastoral systems. More specifically, the Mozambique CwDCC project will reduce drought vulnerability in farming and pastoral communities by guaranteeing water supply and through training the local communities to grow drought-resistant crops, like sweet potato, cassava or sorghum. The project will also help improve the communication lines to make weather forecast and climate information available to communities.</p>\n<p>For updates on UNDP Early Warning Systems and Climate Resilient Development projects, <a href=\"http://ews-undp.blogspot.com/\">click here.</a></p>\n",

Communities will also benefit from improved services associated with stronger national institutions and service providers. “It is within this context that this pilot programme on integrated adaptation strategies, in Grenada, will address the gaps and contribute to improving climate resilience at the national and sectoral levels through an integrated strategic approach to adaptation to climate change,” he said. He said the adaptation project seeks to promote an integrated approach to water resources and coastal zone management, mainstreaming climate change considerations into the water and coastal resource sector.</p>\n<p><em>Source: Caribbean News, </em>8 December 2011.</p>\n",

Zimbabwe’s Second National Communication (MENRM, 2012) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) confirms that Zimbabwe’s temperature has warmed by about 0.6⁰C between 1900 and 2010 and rainfall patterns have undergone significant modifications.</p>\n<p>Changes in precipitation and higher temperatures, coupled with land degradation, poor access to technologies, infrastructure and institutions poorly aligned to deal with climate change will lead to reductions in crop yields, livestock productivity and an increase in poverty. IFPRI predicts that unless action action is taken now to make sure that water facilitates rather than constrain economic development and food security, Zimbabwe will experience severe drought and water constraints by 2050. The Zimbabwe Medium Term Plan (2011-2015) reports that maize yields averaged 1-1.4 tons/ha between 1980 and 1990, dropping to 0.7 tons/ha during 2010/11 partly because of increased inter-annual variability in precipitation. In recent years, farmers in southeast Zimbabwe have been getting a good cereal harvest only once in 5-6 years.  Vulnerability drivers identified include: heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources, poverty, increasing frequency of drought, population pressure, poor climate risk management services from local authorities and local public service institutions, and limited national level policy support.</p>\n<p>An estimated 1.3 million smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe, 70% of these being women, frequently face poverty and hunger (MEPIP, 2012). During the period 2000-2007, Zimbabwe’s real GDP has declined by a cumulative 36%, the agriculture sector has declined by an annual average of 2.4%, and the population below the Food Poverty Line increased from 29% in 1995 to 58% in 2003 (MEPIP, 2011) with most of these being in semi-arid regions of the country and 68% being women headed households. </p>\n<p>The project aims to reduce the vulnerability of rural communities to the adverse impacts of climate variability and change in Zimbabwe.This project is designed to carry out activities, programmes and measures in the areas of adaptation to climate change and the agriculture sector.</p>\n<div> </div>\n<div> </div>\n<p> </p>\n",

Baseline studies and Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessments conducted by CCAP in 2009 and 2010 show that extreme weather events have led to crop production losses ranging from 30 to 60% per annum.  The data show that while flooding could be expected yearly based on historical trends, that over the past decade such events have started to come earlier and extend over longer periods. Events are also affecting larger portions of farmland, not only those in the low-lying areas.  On the other end of the spectrum, drought events have also become an increasing risk factor, particularly over the past 5 years.</p>\n<p>This project aims to reduce poverty through strengthening the resilience of vulnerable farming communities to climate risks in the North of Mindanao, including measures to promote greater productivity, sustainability and increased certainty. The project will deliver this objective through reducing vulnerability in development sectors and strengthening awareness and ownership of adaptation and climate risk reduction processes at local levels.</p>\n<p>For updates on UNDP Early Warning Systems and Climate Resilient Development projects, <a href=\"http://ews-undp.blogspot.com/\">click here.</a></p>\n",

Most aspects of life have suffered: People have been displaced, institutions disintegrated, and essential communal and public infrastructure damaged. People could no longer access markets as they once had and the transport of goods virtually came to a halt. Once-industrious communities that had produced lush harvests of rice, vegetables, fruits, and other crash crops became impoverished.</p>\n<p>After the fighting ended in June 2009, the Government of Sri Lanka has made a concerted effort to recover from the long years of conflict and restore essential services in all parts of the country. The country has now entered into an unprecedented period of political stability, economic growth and development.  A major reconstruction phase is now underway, particularly in the North and East of the country, with Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) requiring resettlement, housing, infrastructure and basic services. At the same time, the coastal zones in the areas in which most of the population live are low lying and exposed to tropical cyclones, storm surges and the effects of sea level rise (such as salinization of groundwater and agricultural lands). The entire North of Sri Lanka is in a dry zone, and its Eastern province is subject to periodic flooding and drought.</p>\n",

The negative impacts on the agricultural and water sector are likely to be considerable. Firstly, yields of staple food crops such as maize, sorghum and beans are likely to decrease, thereby threatening national food security. Secondly, surface flows in rivers and streams are likely to have greater variation, with lower base-flows in the dry season, potentially resulting in water shortages for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. And thirdly, groundwater reserves, which are an important source of water for many rural communities, may be reduced as a result of increased rainfall intensity and concomitant increases in surface runoff. These negative impacts of climate change will be exacerbated by baseline conditions of widespread poverty (63% of the population), high unemployment (40%), a high prevalence of HIV (26% of adults), and widespread land degradation as a result of deforestation, alien plant invasions and overstocking of livestock.</p>\n<p>The goal of the project is to ensure that the management of Swaziland’s water resources is adapted to take into account the anticipated impacts of climate change. To this end, the principles of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) will be used within the project, and importantly, climate change risks will be incorporated into this management approach. To facilitate this process, national dialogue between a wide-range of stakeholders from different sectors will be promoted. In addition, information generated and lessons learned from pilot-scale adaptation measures funded by the project, will assist policy implementation for effective adaptation planning and climate risk management in the water sector. These adaptation measures will be focused on improving access to water in rural communities using two methods, namely: i) piloting improved land-use practices that increase rates of water infiltration into soils; and ii) introducing rainwater harvesting techniques. Such measures will have the long-term effect of recharging groundwater levels and increasing surface flow in rivers and streams during the dry season as well as providing communities with improved access to water for both irrigation and drinking purposes. Additionally, by piloting such adaptation measures, communities will be better equipped to manage climate risks. Lastly, negotiators for Swaziland will be trained to ensure that climate change risks are an integral part of discussions on trans-boundary river management with neighbouring states</p>\n",

Likewise, climate-related impacts on the quality and quantity of water has a gender dimension; in the context of the ethnic tensions, the safety and security of women and girls are compromised as they need to travel further to collect water, also leading to less time for other activities.</p>\n<p>To improve the resilience of water resources to the impacts of climate change in order to improve health, sanitation and quality of  life, and sustain livelihoods in targeted vulnerable areas.  The project will focus on issues of water supply and sanitation.</p>\n<p>For updates on UNDP Early Warning Systems and Climate Resilient Development projects, <a href=\"http://ews-undp.blogspot.com/\">click here.</a></p>\n",

The project focuses on building resilience and adaptive capacity of rural communities relative to their agricultural and water resource management practices, and relative to current and future climate risks.</p>\n<p>More specifically, the project will target five critical agro-ecological zones in Sudan in order to encompass complexity of productive systems and modify current coping strategies that are being undermined by increasing climate variability and reoccurring climatic hazards (such as droughts and floods). Project will introduce, concrete innovative adaptation measures, such as water capture, borehole irrigation, in-situ re-introduction of more stress resistant breeds and crop variaties, sand stabilisation and other land management and agronomic techniques. These will help increase robustness and resilience of highly vulnerable rainfed farming and pastoralist systems to climate change risks. By demonstrating viable and cost-effective adaptation options the project will also assist the government of Sudan to improve its food security policies and address critical social vulnerabilities that often underpin resource-based conflicts, aggrevating human security conditions.</p>\n<p>For updates on UNDP Early Warning Systems and Climate Resilient Development projects, <a href=\"http://ews-undp.blogspot.com/\">click here.</a></p>\n",

Scientific assessments carried out in the context of the Initial National Communication (INC) and the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) has shown that climate change will most probably lead to significant losses in crop production.

The focus is on enhancing resilience to increasing rainfall variability through the diversification of crop cultivation and small ruminants rearing; modifying the timing of crop cultivation in response to changing rainfall patterns; intercropping, irrigation and optimization of lowland/swamp farming practices; pest control, including fencing of farms against rodents, bird scare scrolls, regular weeding, and the use of echoing bells; and, maintaining fast growing nitrogen fixing tree species to improve soil fertility and using multiple-purpose tree species on farmlands to maintain forest cover. However, the widespread introduction and adoption of the strategies to adapt to climate change, faces a series of barriers, including: insufficient knowledge and awareness amongst decision-makers and planners; the current agriculture policies have not taken climate change into account; low capacity of technical staff and extension agents; the lack of information needed by farmers, on climate change and impacts.</p>\n<p>The LDCF Project will address the above barriers, thereby supporting the ongoing process to revitalize the agriculture sector, and ensure that adaptation to climate change is integrated into the revitalization process. Specific contributions toward the reduction of vulnerabilities to climate change will be achieved through the pursuit of specific outcomes including: (a) integrating concerns into relevant policies and planning processes at the state and national levels; (b) comprehensive capacity development for individuals in national agencies focusing on agriculture and in pilot counties, and farmers; (c) demonstration of risk reduction strategies and measures at pilot sites; (d) strengthening technical capacity to integrate climate change risk management into farmer level agricultural capacity; and (e) capturing and disseminating lessons learned to key</p>\n",

At the national level, government, NGOs, and business entities will strengthen capacity to integrate climate change risk reduction strategies into development policies and programmes. National ministries will have developed better-adapted policies and programmes that support planned and autonomous adaptive strategies. Institutional mechanisms for integrating, monitoring and evaluating adaptation across sectors and scales will enhance the adaptive capacity of Niger to address climate change risks. Through better adaptation measures and alternative financing mechanisms, the government will have implemented cost-effective measures of addressing climate change over the short terms and building foundation for middle and long terms measures.</p>\n<p>Capacity will also be developed in the National Meteorological Department to facilitate downscaling of seasonal weather forecasts and packaging of information in a manner appropriate for rural farmers to make informed farm management decisions. This information will be disseminated using communal radio and co-financing will be mobilised for installing radio transmitters in areas that are currently out of range of the radio signal.</p>\n<p>At the local level, fishers, farmers, pastoralists, labourers and others in the pilot sites will have strengthened their adaptive capacity to respond to additional risks and uncertainties posed by climate change. In particular women and vulnerable groups, will have enhanced their livelihoods, spread financial risk, and have strengthened skill development and education, thereby reducing their vulnerability. Local governments and management institutions will be more accountable and transparent, and will integrate climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction into long-term development planning strategies.</p>\n",

This is due, in part, to the reliance of the economy on rainfed agricultural production. Additionally, as a result of the growing population (population growth rate is currently 2.6% per year), the per capita availability of environmental resources (including arable land, water, pasture, forest and biodiversity) is declining.  Climate change threatens to exacerbate the impacts of the over or misuse of the country's environmental resources (including arable land, water, pasture, forest and biodiversity), with concomitant impacts on Ethiopia's environmental, food, water and energy securities.  Currently, approximately 8.29 million people are already considered 'chronically' food insecure while approximately 6.71 million people face 'transitory' food insecurity, both of which are characterised by a weak resilience to withstand climate-related shocks, such as severe droughts.</p>\n<p>The Ethiopian Government has acknowledged the climate change risk the country faces and has stated it as a priority development issue for the country. Currently, adaptation initiatives are being rolled out on a national to local scale, but these are primarily restricted to specific sectoral interventions (for example food security, or environmental protection, or disaster management) and are project based; which means communities are often provided an incomplete set of tools from which to build their overall resilience to climate change. There remains a need to consolidate these interventions, ensure they are robust to a range of likely climate change-futures and integrated into comprehensive adaptation action. This coordination and consolidation is a primary goal of this project.</p>\n<p><em>Source: UNDP Ethiopia Project Identification Form (February 4, 2010).</em></p>\n",

To appropriately address these challenges, and in order to effectively adapt to the effects of climate change, a need to strengthen research on Lake Balaton’s vulnerability was identified.  For the project, integration of ecological and engineering knowledge with social and policy sciences was deemed equally essential.  Key lessons learned from the project implementation indicate that while it is important to establish partnerships with international networks, it is also imperative to target local stakeholders and rely more on local capacities.</p>\n",

At present, there is emerging evidence that agriculture-based livelihoods and overall food security in Cambodia are affected by increased frequency and severity of floods, dry spells and drought events.  A major constraint in moving from a focus on post-disaster relief management to anticipatory agricultural and water resources planning is the limited institutional and individual capacity in both government agencies and community organizations to understand potential climate change impacts on irrigation systems, communal freshwater availability and agricultural production, and to internalize a perspective of longer-term resilience into sectoral policy and development planning processes.</p>\n<p>LDCF support will be used to systematically address institutional and individual capacity gaps in affected rural communities to manage agricultural water resources in a changing climate, and  to demonstrate resilient irrigation, freshwater management, and farming options.  As Cambodia has been undertaking a concerted effort of decentralization, these efforts will primarily focus on provincial, district and communal planning systems, which include Planning and Budgeting Committees, Communal Councils and Farmer Water-Use Committees. The project will work in two contrasting agricultural districts, selected for their high vulnerability as well as for differences in agro-ecological and socio-economic circumstances.  Lessons learned from the project will be systematically replicated in other high risk areas within Cambodia, and made accessible to other countries in the region which face similar climate risk projections for their agriculture-based economies. </p>\n<p><em>Source: Cambodia UNDP Project Document (April 28, 2009)</em></p>\n",

The project also recognizes that in most parts of rural Burkina Faso the agriculture, livestock and agro-forestry sectors are fully integrated and must be developed as a whole - it is not possible to address either agriculture, or livestock or forestry in isolation. Furthermore, in rural Burkina Faso, the combined agriculture, livestock-raising and agro-forestry sector is by far the most important element in the socio-economy, and there is a large equivalence between community development and development of this sector. Accordingly, it is valid to take community development as an initial entry point for development of the agriculture, livestock-raising and agro-forestry sectors.</p>\n<p><i>Source: Burkina Faso UNDP Project Document (March 17, 2009)</i></p>\n",

The coastal region is vulnerable to sea-level rise, with potentially catastrophic impacts on the economy, the population and natural systems. The continued advance of the sea, coastal erosion and the rise in sea level, exacerbated by human activity on the coast, have medium and long-term consequences that are already threatening vulnerable communities and disrupting the least-protected sensitive ecosystems. This paper focuses on the erosion of Benin's coastal region, and analyzes biophysical and socioeconomic vulnerability to the rising sea levels and coastal erosion affecting the city of Cotonou and its coastal plain; it also discusses the ways in which vulnerability could be reduced.</p>\n<p>This project is a direct result of the urgent adaptation priorities identified in Benin’s NAPA. While fully complying with the directions and principles outlined in the LDCF, this project aims to provide the Government of Benin with the necessary technical and financial assistance to promote improved consideration of climate risk in the country’s national policies and most fragile agricultural regions. The ultimate aim of this intervention is to achieve critical improvement in food security and poverty reduction, as defined by the MDGs in Benin. </p>\n<p><i>Source: Benin Project Identification Form (August 28th, 2008)</i></p>\n",

The GLOF risk reduction efforts are mainly focused on structural, hydrological and geo-technical engineered interventions that have been undertaken in some of the places. There is a need to establish a holistic GLOF risk reduction and preparedness mechanism in the region. However, non-structural risk reduction measures such as appropriate early warning systems, awareness raising, coordinated preparedness and land use planning need to be developed and executed in areas affected by GLOFs. Hence, UNDP has initiated this project in order to reduce the risk of GLOFs by promoting community-based risk reduction approaches.</p>\n<p>In addition, the project will also provide an opportunity for networking among practitioners from a range of disciplines, including climate change (CC), disaster risk management (DRM) and environment and development planning for more effective and enhanced knowledge sharing.

Response to date in preparing for the anticipated climate changes have been mostly ad-hoc, reactive and poorly coordinated.

This will be achieved through a suite of strategies, policies and measures that will facilitate adaptation to climate change. Interventions will focus in particular on the management of increased climatic vulnerability and risk in the agrarian and water sectors. An expected impact of this project is that the agrarian and water sectors will become more 'resilient' and thus more resistant to climatic pressures. As the first action-oriented and tangible national climate adaptation project in Guinea-Bissau, this project is an initial important step to assist movement of the country towards a pathway of climate-resilient development. </p>\n",

As the country does not have a large water storage capacity, and the topography of the islands constrains such infrastructure, water supplies are heavily dependent on rainfall. Furthermore, the coastal zone is vulnerable to flooding as a consequence of rising sea surface levels, and increased storm surges from cyclonic activity in the Western Indian Ocean.

The project applies the principles of Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EBA) - a range of strategies for managing ecosystems to increase resilience and maintain essential ecosystem services and reduce the vulnerability of people and the natural environment to climate change impacts.</p>\n<p>Working with communities, local and national governments and NGOs in the Altai and Eastern Steppe landscapes, the project supports integration of ecosystem resilience into land use and water resource planning and management at the landscape level. It supports evidence-based decision making through improved knowledge and understanding on ecosystem dynamics and resilience and impact of different land uses. The project also assists community actions to implement EBA principles and practices for the long-term sustenance of their livelihoods. At the national level, the project supports mainstreaming of the EBA approach in the country’s adaptation framework and related sector policies.
