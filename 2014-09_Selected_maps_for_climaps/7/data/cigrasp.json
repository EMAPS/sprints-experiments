The underlying hypothesis was that the data collected from the meteorological instruments by the community over a period of time would help the community to develop weather based thumb rules for taking appropriate farm decisions based on simple weather parameters like rainfall, wind speed, temperature and relative humidity.About 10 farmers, considered to be ‘Agro-met Farmers’ who used the agro-met data extensively for their farm operations and a set of ‘Control Farmers’ played a key role in demonstrating the utility value of the locally generated information besides providing useful insights on the how the enhanced capacity of the local communities, well managed local institutions help broadening the understanding of climate risks and in providing in-situ solutions. A variety of information was gathered from both the ‘Agro-met’ and ‘Control’ farmers practicing cropping system of maize (Kharif)-wheat (Rabi) through a pre-tested questionnaire and personal interviews at various stages of the crop production process."

Hence, 4 communal nurseries with around 45,000 seedlings were installed in the four districts.Following the good practices in Nicaragua and Chiapas, CEPICAFE started the installation of 10 solar driers in Montero to assure the coffee drying process under changing precipitation patterns. More often unforeseeable rainfalls interrupt the sun drying process during harvest season, thus negatively affecting the quality of the green coffee beans.Furthermore CEPICAFE supported sustainable coffee practices, like soil conservation, irrigation, fertilization, pest control or shadow management."

However, from April 1, 2008 the Act covers all of rural India. It provides a legal guarantee of 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to every rural household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work at the minimum wage rate notified for agricultural labour prescribed in the state or else an unemployment allowance. The main objective of the Act is to supplement wage employment opportunities in rural areas. Some of the key features of the Act are : -100 days of employment to a local rural household if it demands it and is willing to do unskilled manual work -A Job Card is necessary for demanding employment under NREGA. -A written application by a Job Card holding family to the Gram Panchayat or Programme Officer is necessary for demanding employment -All adult members whose names are on the Job Card can apply for employment. The entitlement of 100 days of employment in a financial year is for a household as an aggregate. Creation of durable assets and strengthening the livelihood resource base of the rural poor is one of the main objectives of the Scheme. The permissible works under this Scheme are: -Water Conservation -Drought proofing (including plantation and afforestation)-Flood control and protection works including drainage in water logged areas-Land development-Minor irrigation, horticulture and land development on the land of SC / ST / BPL / Indira Awas Yojana and land reform beneficiaries. -Rural connectivity to provide all-weather access The most important aspect of this Scheme is ensuring that there are a sufficient number of works that are available to respond to the demand for employment within 15 days of demand. The role of Gram Sabha and Gram Panchayat in the planning process is that the Gram Sabha should identify and recommend works and the Gram Panchayat should consolidate and send the recommendations of Gram Sabha to the Programme Officer. The Central government outlay for scheme is 401 billion or Rs. 40,100 crores in FY 2010-11. '"

The outlay was Rs. 110 billion in 2006-2007, and rose steeply to Rs. 391 billion (140% increase in amount with respect to previous 2008-2009 budget) in 2009-2010. As of 30th June,2010 a total of 179,43,189 families in the country have been provided employment under MGNREGS. A specific study carried out in selected villages in Chitradurga district, Karnataka to examine the impact of the NREGA activities from the perspective of providing environmental services and reducing the vulnerability show :<br>• increased ground water recharge,<br>• increased water percolation,<br>• enhanced water storage in tanks,<br>• increase in soil fertility,<br>• reclamation of degraded lands and<br>• carbon sequestration.<br>2. These NREGA activities and the resulting environmental services contributed to increased crop and livestock production.<br>3. There was no example of any significant scale negative impacts from any of the NREGA activities implemented.<br>4. NREGA activities also reduced the vulnerability of crop production, water availability and livelihoods to uncertain and low rainfall, low water availability and poor soil fertility.<br>5. The field studies in Chitradurga have clearly demonstrated the potential of NREGA activities to provide environmental services as well as to reduce vulnerability, despite the short period of only 1 to 3 years to deliver the services. Longer period of 5-10 years is needed to realize the full environmental services or vulnerability reduction potential, due to the gestation period involved (e.g., ground water recharge, soil fertility improvement and forest growth).<br>6. NREGA activities were not implemented in the villages according to any micro-plan or watershed plan or in any sequential manner. Despite this limitation, many NREGA activities have the potential to provide guaranteed benefits. Examples of such activities for Chitradurga district are:<br>• Desilting of water bodies accompanied by silt removal and application to crop fields<br>• Land development leading to land leveling and cropping<br>• Afforestation (as a drought proofing activity) with appropriate species choice<br>• Construction of percolation tanks."
    },
    "additional_information": "Several impact assessment studies have been carried out on NREGA. (1) Independent surveys by economists such as Jean Dreze, found  that NREGA workers had to put up with numerous infringements of their rights without being able to do much about it: lack of work, delays in wage payment, non-payment of minimum wages, absence of worksite facilities, were common. Most of these irregularities remain unaddressed, often even unnoticed. The persistence of corruption is another aspect of this lack of accountability. Three related problems that have contributed to this state of affairs are: confusion about the operational requirements of the Act; absence of any grievance redress system; and lack of independent monitoring.     (2) Winrock India carried out a study of district level convergence between MG-NREGS & ongoing schemes of different Departments/ Ministries to ensure effective convergence for durable asset creation and promote strengthening of the livelihood resource base of the rural poor in the districts of Betul and Sehore in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh in India. It was found that at the district level, convergence is primarily limited to the planning stage itself, with elaborate discussions at the district level meetings amongst the concerned departments. Meanwhile, with inputs from the project team of Winrock, a few plans were developed in the two pilot districts for convergence between MG-NREGS and some line departments’ schemes such as those of Water Resource Department, Forest Department, Agriculture/Horticulture Department through involvement of KVKs for training & extension activities, Sports Department and Fisheries Department.                     (3) Another impact assessment was carried out by the Professional Institutional Networking (PIN) of Ministry of Rural Development, sanctioned by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in the three districts namely Sirsa in Haryana, Sirmaur in Himachal Pradesh and Hoshiarpur in Punjab. Some of the main finding's main findings of Panchayat perception, worksite verification, workers and non workers assessment of NREGS are: Role of Gram Panchayats is becoming extremely crucial in planning and implementation of the rural development scheme. Elected Panchayats in districts of Sirsa and Sirmaur reported that they received training, whereas only one fifth of the Panchayats in Hoshiarpur district received training on NREGA. Regarding the Panchayati Awareness about Measurement Book (MB), it was seen that Panchayats awareness with regard to measurement Book among Panchayat members is very good in Sirsa as compared to Hoshiarpur and Sirmaur District GPs. On the impact of NREGA on employment genaration, all the Panchayats reported that economic condition of the wage earners has improved and moreover the workers need not to go outside the village to seek work. The common problem areas quoted were: lack of Proper trained staff, delay in receiving funds and lack of awareness on different aspect of NREGA guidelines and convergence with other department etc.",

The objective of the proposed project is to integrate the management of SLR risks into the development of Egypt’s Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) in the Nile Delta. To minimize the likelihood of coastal disasters, the most effective adaptation policy options include a combination of(1) Upgraded protection, (2) managing subsidence, and (3) land use planning, focusing new development away from the floodplain, and (worst case) (4) selective relocation away from vulnerable, existing city areas. The proposed project includes upgrading protection through the introduction of Environmentally-friendly ‘soft’ shoreline protection, as well as modifications in regulatory framework and institutional capacity to ensure land use planning, zoning, to account for climate risks."

The lessons drawn from the five experiments can then be applied in larger scale projects.The ACCCA project is currently supporting 19 adaptation pilot actions in 17 countries across Africa and Asia. The pilot projects selected for funding under ACCCA each aim to achieve the following objectives: •\tIdentify and prioritize climate risks to stakeholders and the climate influenced decisions that they face; •\tAssess available knowledge about risks and adaptation opportunities, as well as synthesize the knowledge in terms that are directly relevant to stakeholder concerns and decision-making needs; •\tDevelop, test and disseminate risk communication materials that are designed to assist adaptation decisions; •\tUse the risk communication materials in stakeholder forums to develop recommendations for climate change adaptation and promote their adoption; and •\tIdentify critical knowledge gaps that impede effective adaptation decisions and design assessment activities that would generate new knowledge to fill them.

The project will assist the implementation of the Micronesia Challenge in designating areas for conservation, in order to build resilience to the effects of climate change and address the four threats as described by the IPCC. To achieve this, target sites are identified such as the Yela Swamp Forest in the Federated States of Micronesia, threatened by retreating coastline and advancing land development, the Northern Reefs of Palau affected by coral bleaching, and the island home of the Woja community on Majuro Atoll, which faces freshwater scarcity due to poorly planned water extraction and management. Measures undertaken are mostly conservation activities through collaborative agreements with the local stakeholders."

On some plantations pasture grass is grown in between coconut trees to allow cattle to graze.  Bananas, black pepper, coffee, ginger, turmeric, betel, vegetables and pineapple are the preferred species because they can grow in shade and provide a good income. The most common crop mixtures in mature coconut plantations are coffee and banana; coffee and pineapple; pineapple and papaya; and banana, coffee and cacao.  When farmers intercrop, the coconut trees benefit from the manure and fertilizers, weeds are eliminated, and the land is more productive."

The project is targeted at mountain communities (poor households and women) living in the western and eastern Himalayas. In the state of Uttaranchal the project aims to enhance livelihood opportunities, access required financial resources, manage new technology and institutions, establish non-farm enterprises, increase income through more sustainable cultivation systems.The project works by supporting local entrepreneurship and SHGs and demonstrations covering diverse activities related to agriculture, horticulture, livestock, forestry, soil and water conservation and ecotourism. The project is expected to have the following results: promote approximately 2846 community institutions, capacity building of target population with special emphasis on women and landless labourers, effective savings and credit operation with SHGs, business plan development for establishing enterprise and identification of policy issues affecting livelihoods of poor. The project has set up a company to support small entrepreneurs and help access and interface with financial and credit systems."

Alternate crop combinations are suggested based on the amount of rainfall and specific crop varieties identified for seven different agro-climatic zones.  Crop combinations are developed for three rainfall and drought scenarios - normal rainfall (+-19% of average rainfall), moderate drought (-19-59%) and severe drought (>-59%) situations, and keeping in mind the water availability context  - specifically for  command areas, tank fed areas, well irrigated and dryland areas.  Efforts have been made  to propose cropping pattern that are economically viable.  Farmers may choose the appropriate cropping pattern, based on the seasonal rainfall forecast given by Department of Agricultural Meteorology, fifteen days before the start of the season."

Consequently, a transition into a pro-active, adaptive management approach is imperative. It calls for a highly integrated management concept at catchment level, based on sound understanding of the interdependence of different key factors, such as economic and human needs, environmental requirements and management capacity under CC conditions. One starting point is a detailed analysis of the biophysical baseline and environmental as well as social-economic responses, in order equitably allocate water to all sectors. Knowledge of levels of vulnerability and policy driven opportunities of adaptability within selected catchments will bring comprehensive awareness of alternative strategies, for all of which adequate information management is also critical."

The performance evaluation studies indicated increased availability of ground water especially in lean months. In the X plan a rain water harvesting and artifial recharge to ground water was taken up in over-exploied blocks of four states. In the XI plan, the scheme of Artificial Recharge to Groundwater through dugwells has been taken up under the mandate of the Overall Master Plan for Artificial Recharge to Groundwater, prepared in 2002 by the Central Ground Water Board. This scheme promotes ground water recharge by promoting and financing the construction of dug well recharge structures for the 4.455 million existinging irrigation wells.  This includes a filter pit for simple filteration of rainwater that is then diverted into existing wells for groundwater recharge.This scheme is implemented in 1180 blocks of seven states namely, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat &amp; Madhya Pradesh at an estimated cost of Rs. 1798.71 crores given by the Ministry of Finance through NABARD. The scheme provides 100% subsidy to marginal and small farmers and 50% subsidy to other farmers. An increase in ground water recharge will improve agricultural production (irrigation) and drinking water supply, enhance drought mitigation and benefit economic development. It will also mitigate ground water quality problems such as that of floride."

There are several potential climate chaneg adaptation and human well-being benefits from small and medium scale hydropower plants. The present project has therefore been launched to analyze the effect of small and medium sized hydropower plants on the adaptation to a changed climate and the possible symbioses and trade offs with the rural development.The project’s objectives are:1. To understand the benefits of small and medium scale hydropower plants in climate change adaptation as well as rural development; 2. To recommend mitigation measures to minimize impacts from small and medium scale hydropower plants on environment and human well-being, especially to poor communities."

Few predators can access these kernels, as the fruits are very hard and it takes 5 tons of pressure to break them. Babassu kernels are good sources of oil and protein, which are often not readily available to the native populations of Amazonia. Other uses of the babassu palm include construction material, woven containers, mats, fuel and ritual applications. The palm is fire-resistant, juveniles (pindovas) can remain in the forest under-story for as long as 50 years, ultimately yielding an accumulation of up to 6,000 plants/ha."

These practices include improved catchment management of wetlands and rivers to increase stream flows ground water recharge and water quantities, the removal of alien vegetation, ensuring appropriate livestock numbers and grazing rotations for herd and veld health, soil management including erosion control, fire management as well as setting aside portions of land for erosion buffers, biodiversity corridors, etc. CI staff provide the support function to the farmers which would normally provided by agricultural extension services, which is not available due to limited resources. The area is under threat  from un-sustainable farming activities, such as overgrazing, ploughing up of wetlands and indiscriminate burning.  These threats are addressed through the agreements, in which farmers undertake to implement certain conservation actions, like stock reduction, cooperation with wetland restoration and the formation of a fire management plan and alternative predator control methods.  In return, CI implements enabling actions that will support farmers in adopting these better land management practices. Currently the BRI has 22 members, 2 of which are private farmers and the rest communal farmers.  The area thus under better management at present, on which these 22 members farm, is roughly 9000 ha.

The context establishment phase covers activities of steering committee establishment, GHG emission inventory, climate change impact mapping and identification of risks and opportunities for GHG emission reduction and for adaptation. The second phase covers activities of identification of prioritized areas for actions and goals setting such as emission reduction targets and targets for enhancing adaptive capacity and resilience. The third phase is to develop an integrated climate action plan and implement the actions,  that is a process to agree on key sectors to be addressed and related joint strategies for mitigation and adaptation, and to set realistic targets for both mitigation and adaptation actions within defined time frames. The last phase, monitoring and evaluation, includes assessment of target achievement and systematically reconsidering strategy and actions when necessary."

Information on adaptation seems to be reaching the people as is evident from the fact that now almost 40 farmers use salt-tolerant paddy in Mousuni Island since last year when the centre had started. As the market value of this variety (tal mugur) is not far behind other high-yielding varieties, farmers on the island have been successful in maintaining their livelihoods without having to worry about losing crops to salt water incursion. Also, the number of volunteers in disaster response teams has significantly gone up.  At present a community elected institution runs the centre with support from WWF."

The method is designed to be applicable at village or local community level. It adapts the framework of the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) for vulnerability assessment of inter-linked societal-and-environmental systems. The procedure includes preparation, primary data collection through field observation and in-depth interviews, a qualitative analysis to portrait people’s vulnerability using a score-card table, and adaptation options identification. Vulnerability is defined in a broad way and includes non-climatic causes such as socio-ecnomic factors. Good local knowledge and experiences helped in validating the vulnerability analysis and in identifying adaptation options."

They generally included the sharing of scientific and local information, outings to see local examples of farming practice, and discussions on how farmers might plan their farming activities given the most up to date weather forecasts available on the South African Weather Service’s website. Seasonal weather forecasts were integrated into appropriate livelihood strategies including the choice of crop, timing of cropping and technological options. Farmers expressed a desire to record their own rainfall and temperature data, and were supplied by the project with the necessary and appropriate devices to do so. The information was recorded in climate diaries and discussed at the subsequent workshops."

Given the limited size of the geographic area, together with the use of incomplete historical data from only 5 weather stations, CSAG emphasized that the results are not conclusive, and require further investigation and research. However, the report concludes that an increase in maximum and minimum temperatures is likely, with warming particularly in autumn. Furthermore, an increase of up to 2.5 degrees Celcius is projected for the end of the 21st century, based on the SRESA2 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Special Report on Emissions Scenario) emissions scenario. Precipitation, given the complex nature of its drivers, was less easy to predict. Generally, precipitation is likely to stay the same, or otherwise decrease slightly. It is predicted that rainfall events will be fewer, but more intense. The report concludes that agricultural activities and livelihoods are likely to be negatively impacted by the projected changes.\r<br>",

      "feedback": "Natural floods are important contributors to the Mekong river system. They are improving the livelihood and productivity of local farmers and riverside dwellers by providing additional fertile soil for agriculture by sediment deposition. At the same time, extreme flood events threaten people’s lives and their income sources by destroying harvests and infrastructure. In recent decades, the Mekong Basin has endured a significant increase in extreme floods. This is due to man-made alterations in the river system and also due to changes in rainfall patterns. International climate change studies have projected a continuation if not an acceleration of this trend. The increased probability and severity of floods are a danger for the population, particularly in the Mekong floodplain, but also those near tributaries prone to flash flooding. Additionally, sea level rises of up to one meter are projected, thus making the Mekong Delta one of the five deltas in the world most vulnerable to climate change impacts.One of the key tasks of the Mekong River Commission (MRC) is to tackle flood events in a coordinated manner. The MRC has begun assessing likely impacts of possible future climate change on flood generation and propagation as well as flood risk in the Lower Mekong Basin. The MRC’s Flood Management and Mitigation Programme (FMMP) is supported in improving flood forecasting and management capacities of the relevant line agencies of the MRC Member Countries. The Regional Flood Management and Mitigation Centre (RFMMC) receives support in adjusting its current flood forecasting system to incorporate climate change scenarios.In the long run, these efforts will help protect the poorest and most vulnerable parts of the population in the four countries."

Based on the results, MRC will be in a position to forecast floods even under a changing climate. Also, MRC can advise Member Countries in which regions to focus their flood preparedness, mitigation and management efforts. Using the flood forecasting system of MRC, national institutions can design, plan and implement climate change adaptation measures related to flooding. In order to gather practical experiences in this field, flood protection measures are being implemented in areas prone to suffer from increased flooding in the future."

      "feedback": "Burundi’s population is mostly poor, suffering from recurring food shortages and famines. Most people depend on agriculture and thus, on soil and water resources. These resources are endangered by inadequate water resource management and intensive farming on steep slopes. Climate change is further aggravating existing environmental problems and endangering Burundi’s socio-economic development. Resource dependence, lack of adaptive capacity, and state institutions underprepared for climate change lead to high vulnerability overall. Currently, Burundi is losing 5-17% (estimate) to extreme weather events.On the national, provincial, and local levels, decision-makers are supported in developing climate aware policies and integrating climate change into their strategies and investment plans. On the local level in selected catchment areas, user groups, municipalities and state facilities are enabled to independently plan, implement, and monitor adaptation measures.The project has a three-pronged strategy to reduce the vulnerability of the population of Burundi:1.\tMainstreaming climate change and adaptation into the political framework. Relevant decision-makers in Burundi are scattered across institutions and levels, making effective planning difficult and hampering implementation of Burundi’s national adaptation programme in everyday planning. Inter-sectoral user groups as well as public education and training of civil servants, will help improve coordination and efficiency.2.\tImplementing specific adaptation measures in particularly vulnerable catchment areas. This includes places with rapid degradation of national resources and marginalised groups such as women, girls, and internal refugees. This part involves public education, training user groups as facilitators, agricultural extension, and set-up of local pilot projects in infrastructure.3.\tSupporting the set-up of a country-wide early warning and information system for daily and seasonal weather forecasts and extreme events. This entails improving coordination between IGEBU and PNPRGC, and training both information providers and users in disseminating and using weather and climate information. Existing disaster management infrastructure is either included and improved upon or built from scratch together with local colline authorities (smallest administration unit)."

The project aims thus at informing national and regional decision makers about the potential impacts of climate change on natural resources in their region. They are enabled to better adapt their strategies of natural resource management in the light of climate change and to better stand their ground in the post-Kyoto negotiations. Projected changes in climate variables (temp. and prec.) available from various global and regional models (77 data-sets) have been used to project the changes along two scenarios (RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5) with a higher resolution (50km) for the Congo Basin. Based on these results, an assessment of the related changes in the hydrology of the Congo Basin has been conducted and the potential impacts of those changes on the agriculture-, energy- and forest-sector have been projected for mid- and end of the century. After an additional analysis of the correlation between precipitation and GDP, propositions are made for potential adaptation strategies. In a nutshell, the results show a significant increase in temperature, independent of the models and scenarios used, while the total precipitation is unlikely to change dramatically. It is foremost the variability in precipitation and the frequency of extreme meteorological events which will increase and ask for tailored solutions. The carbon storage and extension of the forests is projected to slightly increase while the agricultural sector will be confronted to droughts and inundations, especially in the northern and southern parts of the region, close to or already within the Sahel-zone. Linux-Computers to continue working with the results have been handed over to five research institutions in the region and capacity development measures for the researchers and the decision makers have been implemented.Results of the project are available at http://www.climate-service-center.de/congo-project , where you can find the final report, fact sheets, and interactive maps and figures."

The project applies an integrated approach by addressing legal and regulatory issues that might hamper the market launch of index-based insurances, and by supporting re- and primary insurance companies and other financial service providers to develop demand-oriented weather insurance products for the respective target groups in the pilot regions. To this end, GTZ cooperates with the insurance regulator (CIRC), the Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA), Chinese and foreign insurance and re-insurance companies and financial intermediaries.The project identifies and analyses weather perils in all provinces of China. Through a thorough analysis of past weather events and the economic and social losses resulting from those weather events, the exposure of different households and enterprises to weather perils are analyzed. Through household surveys and client studies the potential demand for weather insurance products is assessed. All this extensive research will then result in the development of suitable weather insurance products, possibly on the basis of parametric triggers, meaning that e.g. farmers will receive insurance payouts once a certain trigger (such as a certain precipitation or water levels  for a flood insurance) is reached.'"

Therefore, the interchange of knowledge between scientists and local actors was a central part of the project. Based on a participatory process with a wide range of actors coming from different levels and sectors (public, private, academia, civil society) in Santiago de Chile, the project contributed to the development of competences and capacities. The Regional Climate Adaptation Plan with the developed measures has been handed over to the Regional Government and the Regional Secretary of the Ministry of the Environment who are currently planning the implementation of the plan. The establishment of a Regional Learning Network between six megacities in Latin America: Mexico-City, Bogotá, Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Santiago de Chile and Lima allowed for exchange and mutual learning between scientists and decision-makers of these cities evolved with regard to climate change and response activities.Objective and activitiesThe main objective of the ClimateAdaptationSantiago (CAS) project was the development of climate change adaptation measures for the Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile in the most highly affected sectors: energy, water, and land use. Scientists from two research centers within the Helmholtz Association worked in close collaboration with partners in Latin America in order to develop a Regional Climate Change Adaptation Plan which includes the developed adaptation measures.The activities included the downscaling of global climate change models to the Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile, an estimation of the related impacts on energy and water supply and demand as well as on the generation of flood and heat hazards. Vulnerabilities were analyzed and suitable adaptation measures developed in a participatory round table process (10 roundtables over a 2,5-year time period).For the establishment of the Regional Learning Network three international workshops were organized in order to exchange knowledge and practical experiences regarding climate change adaptation. State of implementation/resultsThe Regional Climate Change Adaptation Plan with the developed measures has been handed over to the Regional Government and the Regional Secretary of the Ministry of the Environment who are currently planning the implementation. This final plan was accompanied by a manual for its implementation. Furthermore, a manual for the broader public was developed as well as context-specific information material for three selected municipalities. The overall results of the Regional Learning Network have been published. "

The key vulnerabilities that the study focused on were: coastal vulnerability to climatic hazards, SLR (Sea Level Rise) and saltwater intrusion and deriving a vulnerability range determining climatic hazard risk zones along the coast. The vulnerabilities will be assessed using a mix of secondary literature to understand the nature of occurrence of climatic hazards, hazard mapping, genarating an analytical model to indicate area under inundation under different levels of SLR and bio physical and socio economic impact assessment. Based on the vulenrability and impact assessments, the study would bring out policy recommendations. These will feed into identifying areas for interventions for the development of suitable adaptation strategies and developing the state Disaster Management Plans."

It will also be implemented multi-irrigation systems that will allow water accumulation from low-flow water springs for supplemental irrigation during long periods without rainfalls saving agricultural production. This implicates the construction of 15 irrigation systems in 5 communities in the area of Alto Seco. Each system will store 1500 m3 of water, which will cover the water needs for irrigation purposes.

In each area to be reforested, the project is implemented undertaken in three stages 1. Site Selection based on social (community association in existence, community desire, viability, potential for favela expansion) and environmental (severity of slopes, presence of water sources and springs, drainage basin areas, size of site) criteria; 2. Site Preparation The site is cleared, drainage canals and roads built, and the soil plowed, with fertilizer made from composted municipal waste worked into the soil to improve nutrient content and overall soil quality. In areas with very steep slopes, terraces are built to stabilize the soil, increasing water retention and reducing erosion. At the same time, seedlings cultivated from a municipally-owned model farm forest nursery are selected by forest engineers to best suit the nature of the site being reforested. 3. Planting and Maintenance The prepared sites are planted using forest succession principles involving primary and secondary species.Resources required  labour, tools, tree seedlings"

Main project’s objective is to build sustainable community and household resilience to floods in highly flood-prone, inland areas of the Mekong Delta by reducing the vulnerability to flooding of household and communes in Long An, Dong Thap and An Giang provinces.In the past two decades flooding in the Mekong that impacts by climate change has become unpredictable, increasing in frequency, duration and intensity. The three targeted provinces suffer the most frequent and persistent flooding in the Mekong. In 2002, large-scale flooding lead to the death of 163 people, destruction of houses and the spread of water-related diseases.Project has three main components:1. Community-based disaster management: Facilitating changes in the way communities prepare for, adaptation, respond to and recover from disasters implemented at both village and commune level.2. Institutional capacity building: Building the capacity of CARE’s implementing partner Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) by raising the understanding of and skills to apply participatory approaches and methodologies as well as adaptation and preparedness measures amongst DARD members.3. Livelihood diversification and alternative income generation: Assisting poor and marginalized individuals and families in diversifying their income sources during non-disaster periods as well as securing alternative income generation opportunities in times of disaster."

Nandi Foundation undertook the mobilisationand collects user fees, and in return gets a performance based subsidy linked to the delivery of pre-agreed outputs including three months of billed water services. This  output-based subsidy approach requires that tariffs paid by users for consumption cover the costs of operation and maintenance, user-fee collection, and education and communication activities with key stakeholders and vulnerable groups.Each scheme included a water treatment plant connected to a water distribution point from which users obtain water in jerry cans.

This is also jeopardising the unique species diversity of the country. Policy-makers and the wider public have become aware of climate change impacts but a lack of consistent adaptation strategies remains. The project aims to develop strategies for adaptation to climate change and conservation of biodiversity and to implement these in specific cases. Existing structures such as the secretariat of the climate change committee will be strengthened by providing intensive consultancy and training. The development of national adaptation strategies will be supported in processes involving close cooperation with relevant government bodies, local authorities, the private sector and civil society. Moreover, tangible measures to conserve biodiversity will be financed within the context of small-scale projects. The project will also raise awareness among authorities and the population of the issues surrounding climate protection and climate change."

Restoration includes “coral gardening”, which seeks to rescue temperature tolerant and slow-growing massive corals from situations of overgrowth, extreme shallows, and severe bleaching events. The first step has been to reduce pollution stress on the corals, the community engaged in planting mangroves and improving waste management. Next steps were to plant fast-growing corals and remove the coral-eating crown of thorn starfish. The community also engaged in constructing fish-houses, stone and cement structures that serve as shelter for coral and fish and also absorbing wave energy. A decisive element was to plant the corals in large colonies to promote resistance and survival."

Destructive fishing practices, overexploitation of coastal and marine fisheries for local and export markets as well as the weakening of the adaptation capacity of the local flora and fauna as a result of climate change are leading to a loss of marine resources affecting the welfare of the population heavily dependent on the sea and its resources for livelihoods, food security and income. Covering the Economic Zones of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Malaysia, Philippines, Timor Leste and the Solomon Islands, the loss of biodiversity in the region could affect more than 200 million people. In response, the governments of the six countries have launched a 'Coral Triangle Initiative on Coral Reefs, Fisheries and Food Security'. The project aims at establishing two large Marine Protection Areas respectively in the Savu Sea, Indonesia, and in the Kimbe Bay-Bismarck Sea area of Papua New Guinea to increase the regions' resilience to climate change. A network of smaller Marine Protected Areas will combine science-based marine protection with community-based measures matching the socio-economic needs of the local population, in order to maintain a robust ecosystem which still allows for sustainable development."

The project aims to delineate and mark the HTL along the coasts of Tamil Nadu by erection of stone pillars. The delineation work will be done using remote sensing and the pillars will be fixed along the coast for identification of the HTL on ground for the coastal community. The HTL will also be superimposed on the village cadastral maps to identify setback lines as prescribed by the CRZ notification. This will identify the HTL on the ground and help in implementation of the coastal zone regulation more effectively. The likely impacts would be (1) less pressure on vegetation in the setback areas as they will be clearly identified, thus maintaining storm buffers, and (1) reduce the risk of loss of property by preventing building near the coast, especially if the HTL may shift with sea level rise in the next 50-100 years."

In this way, it is sure less suspended materials and pollutants enter into container.2, Smells of sea water mainly resulted from alga, bacteria and microbe etc. Experiments show that both the sodium hypochlorite and chlorine dioxide can be used as a disinfector to remove the odor.3, A storage pool for treated sea water is constructed in the community water station. The frequency conversion water supply system, which was designed to regulate water flow according to the real time water consumption and make sure the constant pressure at the pipe end, is used to provide water to the household."

Prolonged dry periods have caused significant damage to agriculture and changed the salinity of groundwater thus damaging aquaculture.The project’s main objectives are:1.  To assess the climate vulnerability of rural communities in the most drought-prone areas of Ninh Thuan province. As part of this study, perception surveys were conducted to identify the degree to which the perceptions of communities limited the efficacy of the activities of various intervening agencies.  2. To identify possible adaptation measures to mitigate the impacts on rural communities of ever-increasing climate variability and change, in terms of droughts, with an emphasis on identification of adaptation measures."

The project started in 2012, and most of the activities conducted at the moment are related to the first three topics below:1. Research on climate change impacts to understand the vulnerability of Central American ecosystems and smallholder farmers (both subsistence and coffee) to climate change, taking into account the interests and needs of key stakeholders and to select the smallholder farming communities where the household surveys will take place.2. Vulnerability assessment to identify which smallholder (both subsistence and coffee-producing) farming communities, ecosystems and ecosystem services in the target countries are most vulnerable to climate change.3. Ecosystem-based Adaptation strategies identification to document household livelihood strategies used to cope with past climatic variability and local knowledge about expected impacts of climate change across a range of different smallholder communities, at both household and community level.4. Ecosystem-based Adaptation evaluation to test the effectiveness of existing on-farm activities that are relevant for EbA in a subset of communities by collecting detailed information on the characteristics, management, and implementation of those activities, and their performance in the face of climate change. 5. Institutional Analysis to identify the local and national institutions (both formal and informal) that could promote EbA approaches among vulnerable smallholder farming communities (both subsistence and coffee-producing) and define strategies for strengthening these institutions role in promoting EbA and smallholder resilience to climate change.6. Capacity Building for Ecosystem based adaptation to strengthen capacity of key organizations and institutions to support implementation of Ecosystem-based adaptation approaches with smallholder farming communities (at both household and community levels) by developing and delivering targeted training courses and extension materials.7. Multiplication and amplification to promote the incorporation of EbA approaches in national and regional adaptation strategies and other relevant policies through dissemination of project results to a wide set of stakeholders and decision-makers (e.g., government, civil society, academic) at national, regional and international levels.

In many cases, because natural systems provide multiple adaptation benefits, they are potentially much more cost effective than hard-engineered solutions. However, experience in both identifying and implementing ecosystem-based adaptation activities are in their infancy. Here we propose to identify and implement ecosystem-based adaptation activities in three very diverse settings, which will serve as models for amplification of ecosystem-based adaptation in other areas.To increase the resilience and adaptive capacity of vulnerable people to climate change, CI will assess the potential for Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) solutions in the Philippines, South Africa and Brazil; implement pilot EbA solutions; and provide capacity building, linking lessons learned to local, national and international climate adaptation planning and policy.The identification and implementation of these ecosystem-based adaptation activities will help inform other EbA activities around the world. This work will provide examples from marine and terrestrial settings, including fisheries dependent on coral reefs, coastal protection by mangroves, livestock grazing in semi-arid systems, agriculture in tropical forests and freshwater use. The project will work with regional and national authorities to capitalize on these examples in other settings within the three countries, and will work with international policy bodies to create conditions which will allow replication of these results in other countries.The project is generously funded by the German Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety under the framework of the International Climate Initiative (IKI) and will run until July 2015."

The project will propose sources of alternative livelihoods that build ecosystem management In many cases, there are some initial experiences, and it is particularly important to diversify income bases under changing climate, and have a portfolio of livelihood options. The project is a joint and complementary effort of UNEP, UNDP and IUCN. All three partners have a strong background in EBA and related fields. UNEP provides overall coordination for the project, while UNDP and IUCN are responsible for country level coordination through the UN country teams. As the programme develops, other countries and other ecosystems will be added.The objective of the project is to strengthen the capacities of Nepal, Peru and Uganda to strengthen ecosystem resilience for promoting ecosystem based adaptation (EBA) options and to reduce the vulnerability of communities, with particular emphasis on mountain ecosystems. The project consists of four components: 1.\tthe development of methodologies and tools for mountain ecosystems;2.\tthe application of the above tools and methodologies at the national level;3.\tthe implementation of EBA pilots at the ecosystem level; and4.\tthe formulation of national policies and building an economic case for EBA at the national level.The project aims to create new opportunities for experimental learning between regions and among countries within the same region. Through parallel and cooperative development and application of methodologies and tools, and the implementation of pilot projects, the project will shorten the learning curve of local and national institutions and fast track the transfer of knowledge and experience for building ecosystem resilience."

      "feedback": "EPIC aims to help protect communities and selected ecosystems and ecosystem services from disasters and tackle the adverse effects of climate change. Through quantitative and scientific evidence, the project will demonstrate how healthy ecosystems can help reduce impacts and risks of specific hazards and make livelihoods more resilient.Avalanches and landslides threaten human settlements, transportation and other infrastructure in mountainous regions of countries such as Nepal, Chile and China. Coastal communities in Thailand are becoming more exposed to tropical storms, with the loss of traditional livelihoods due to the conversion of mangrove forests to short-lived shrimp farms. Unpredictable rainfall, droughts, floods and other extremes seriously affect communities in Burkina Faso and Senegal, where declining agricultural productivity is already linked with climate change.Around the world, environmental degradation reduces the capacity of ecosystems such as forests and wetlands to meet people’s need for food and fresh water and to protect them from hazards by providing a natural, physical buffer, by helping regulate floods and by stabilizing slopes. Healthy and diverse ecosystems can prove to be not only robust in the face of extreme weather but are also important given the services and benefits they provide immediately following a disaster and during recovery. The Ecosystems Protecting Infrastructure and Communities (EPIC) project will be implemented in six countries, led by IUCN in collaboration with ProAct Network, a Swiss NGO.The goal of the project is to document evidence that highlights the need for promoting and conserving ecosystem services for both climate change adaptation and in planning for disaster risk reduction.In addition to tangible interventions on the ground, EPIC will also work with policy-makers at national and local levels to promote policies that link sectors such as environment, disaster management, land-use planning and public finance, and help in co-ordinated planning through providing lessons learned and best practices.Empirical and applied scientific information will be compiled from case studies addressing different scenarios in Chile (snow avalanches), China and Nepal (landslides), Burkina Faso and Senegal (droughts and floods) and Thailand (coastal hazards). Based on lessons learned from the case studies, and building on resources available through the PEDRR (Partnerships for Environment and Disaster Risk Reduction) EPIC workshops will be held to improve awareness and technical capacities on ecosystem-based risk management in the selected countries.It is hoped that longer term ecosystem-based adaptation strategies will be built upon the results shown from managing ecosystems for disaster risk reduction."

El Niño is a recurring threat in Peru that can bring catastrophic rainfall and flooding along its northern coast. That assessment led to a focus on the region of Piura and the design of an innovative index insurance product that utilizes measures of Pacific sea surface temperatures obtained from NOAA as the basis of payment. These values are highly predictive and correlated with the extreme El Niño events and their consequences in Piura. The unique aspect of this index is that the sea surface temperatures can signal a severe El Niño months in advance of its impact on land, enabling an insurance payment to be made several months before the onset of catastrophic weather. The advance payment can then be used for risk mitigation and adaptation strategies to reduce losses and disruptions from the impending disaster."

There are six components to the project. The first component of the project is flood control and management. This component will include both structural and non-structural activities including dikes strengthening, access roads, cross dike structures and water level control structures, an integrated flood warning system, and riverbank landscaping works. This component will also improve the level of flood protection in selected areas of Xining Municipality and in a comprehensive flood warning system. The second component of the project is wastewater collection. This component will support the construction of about 72.5 km of both wastewater and urban storm water collection pipelines to intercept an estimated 33 million tons of wastewater and storm water drainage, which at present flows freely to the river systems in the Municipality, to deliver to existing or proposed wastewater treatment facilities. The third component of the project is participatory watershed management. This component will involve three integrated sets of sub-activities to allow communities to respond to varying soil and water conservation, land use, socio-economic conditions in the 17 individual highest priority sub-watersheds within the municipality. The fourth component of the project is institutional strengthening and capacity building. This component will support construction of a flood warning center, provision of office equipment, consulting services, technical study and research, and training and study tours. The fifth component of the project is resettlement and environmental management. This component will support resettlement and rehabilitation of displaced persons in connection with the implementation of the project, and managing the adverse environmental impacts resulting from the implementation of the project through establishment and operation of environmental management offices, provision of consulting services, and carrying out monitoring and supervision. The six component of the project is project management. This component will support development and operation of a management information system and strengthening the capacity of Xining Municipality to carry out procurement, construction, supervision, quality control, financial management, and monitoring and evaluation with respect to the project."

This City has completed a sea level rise risk assessment.  However as a coastal City, the marine environment provides a key service to the City as a receiving environment for freshwater run-off and stormwater discharge.  Burgeoning development and the attendant increases in the built environment within the City has resulted in an increase in run-off which places increased pressure on the City’s stormwater systems as well as its catchments.  The City must begin to investigate and understand the potential combined effects of coastal storm surges, mean sea level rise and increased freshwater and stormwater flow.  It is highly likely that these events would coincide given that the storms responsible for extreme rainfall events would often result in coastal wave surges. The combined effect of intense rainfall, high winds and storm surges has the potential to increase flood risk and infrastructure damage.    "

As a response measure, PROAGRO has partnered with the GTZ’s Climate Protection Program to design an adaptation to climate change pilot project that targets the special needs of women in the two affected communities. The project seeks to stabilize livelihoods and diversify incomes, without increasing the work load for women. A further goal of the pilot is to increase awareness and improve information about climate change.The pilot’s activities focus on capacity building, natural resource protection and production of new crop varieties. Weather stations have been installed in both communities to provide information about temperature and precipitation that can be communicated to the national meteorological service. Community members have participated in workshops to improve their knowledge about climate change. Trainings have been carried out to adapt forest, water and soil management practices to changing climatic conditions. New crop varieties have been introduced to diversify both family nutrition and incomes, as well as improve food security. In all cases, emphasis has been placed on giving women a leadership role in managing the new activities."

The following measures were undertaken to improve the resilience of the small-scale farmers:Through quarterly climate preparedness workshops farmers together with scientists discussed climate change projections and trends in the Suid Bokkeveld region, including adaptation options and long term strategies.  In the workshops farmers learned to integrate seasonal weather forecast into their decision making.Mentor farmers trained their fellow farmers in soil erosion control and the removal of alien species.As a result of the training farmers created wind breaks and retention buffers in their tea production areas. Through the learning process initiated by the project farmers changed to more sustainable agricultural practices e.g. mulching as a method to conserve moisture and increase plant nutrients.Finally, farmers learned to monitor the growth of wild and cultivated rooibos stands, and were able to enhance their management abilities according to findings. In the participatory research farmers discovered that wild rooibos has a greater resilience to severe climatic events than cultivated varieties. Two communities of small-scale rooibos farmers, currently organised as the Heiveld Co-operative and the Wupperthal Tea Association, have been harvesting wild and cultivated rooibos, and have become the de facto guardians of the wild rooibos genetic stock."

Here are some of the findings from the project:\r<br>•\tThere is a real enthusiasm amongst farmers in isolated communities to gain more understanding of global climatic patterns, and how these affect their livelihoods and their lifestyles.\r<br>•\tA learning process that supports the sharing of information and experiences at both global and local scales breaks people’s sense of isolation and helplessness, and creates new capacities for positive action to mitigate the effects of climate change. \r<br>•\tAdaptations are most effective when based on existing knowledge. \r<br>•\tThe role of formal and informal institutions at a range of scales is critical for supporting adaptation.\r<br>•\tThe project has shown that positive synergies may be found between rural livelihoods, conservation of biodiversity and successful adaptation to climate change. \r<br>\r<br>Finally, the learning approach adopted in the project has enhanced local knowledge and broadened farmers’ capacities to respond in a proactive manner.  The project used  indigenous adaptive capacity as a starting point, combined with relevant external knowledge, rather than imposing adaptation plans in a top-down manner.

The projects goal is to contribute to the significant reduction in human suffering and negative effects of natural disasters.The project objective is to reduce human suffering and negative effects of natural disasters on the most vulnerable people of Vietnam by strengthening Vietnamese capacities to adapt and respond to natural disasters that are enhanced by climate change.Basic idea was awareness-raising about the impacts of climate change on livelihoods and the need to be prepared to adapt. So NGOs make climate change impacts part of their focus. Furthermore The Red Cross produced two documentaries that were broadcast on national television.Also the theme of climate change impacts was integrated into participatory community assessments, which resulted in the identification of community-specific vulnerabilities and solutions (e.g., loud speaker systems for early warning, construction of dams and tree barriers as defense for agricultural land against winds and salt water intrusion).The project focused on 30 disaster prone coastal communes in 5 provinces ( Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan) which are most vulnerable areas."

Climate change affects different regions, generations, income groups and genders differently. Developing countries, such as Bangladesh and the Pacific Region have already been highly affected. Poor people, a disproportionate amount of which are female are particularly vulnerable, and at the same time key actors. All too often, gender issues have been neglected so far in local and national climate policy-making. Women and communities have their own visions and knowledge on how to build and strengthen their resilience to climate change. And such visions are tied to the broader realities of power relationships that are informed by class, gender, ethnicity and citizenship. The initiative will further harness the capacities of communities, primarily women on adaptation and low carbon development in Bangladesh and parts of the Pacific Region (Kiribati, Nauru, Republic of Marshall Islands). This likewise provides opportunities for women to engage in local and national climate change policies. In this context, the project partners will develop training material, as well as indicators and methods for selecting and monitoring of ‘gender sensitive adaptations measures’, and policy proposals. Global exchange and multiplication of the project’s content and results will be provided by a Global Learning Platform, which will be organised by GenderCC’s International Secretariat. The platform will involve and connect practitioners from around the world working in these fields. While in the inchoate phase the International Secretariat and the two project partners will provide the bulk of the content, the circle of participants will widen, involving the wider GenderCC network and in the long run, the global women, gender, climate change and environmental community."

Small terraces are created for growing crops and fruit trees that would normally struggle to survive in this arid climate. The Institut des Régions Aride (IRA) together with local farmers developed technologies to improve the jessour and to avoid destruction of the spillways trough heavy rain. Other improvements include the ‘buried stone pocket’ for the localized, underground irrigation of fruit trees to increase the efficiency of water use."

However, tenurial insecurity and excessive governmental control, and low community interest can lead to sub-optimal outcomes.  Increasing share in timber revenue will help.

Wildlands Conservation Trust facilitators teach individuals in these communities how to grow indigenous trees from seed and care for the plants until they reach a certain height. These individuals are referred to as ‘tree-preneurs’. The trees are then traded back to Wildlands for food, clothes, bicycles, agricultural goods and tools, school and university fees. The trees are then either planted back into the communities or planted out in Wildlands’ forest restoration projects. The project supports the ongoing establishment of the Jobe, Ongoye and Buffelsdraai Carbon sinks and the identification and development of new sinks in southern KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape, using pro-poor development methodologies in pursuit of this overall objective. Wildlands calculates that for every hectare of the 1000 hectares being re-forested on the three sites, 3 to 41/2 tonnes of CO2 will be sequestered per year over a 20-year period. This amounts to 60 000-90 000 tones of CO2 removed from the atmosphere over the project’s lifespanSpecific measures:1.Support the growing, planting and care of 40 000 seedlings per annum, using the Indigenous Trees for Life pro-poor methodology, across the existing (and new) sinks.2.The management of this process, with emphasis on the training and capacity building of the tree-preneurs and planting and caring SMME’s.3.The ongoing development of the Wildlands Carbon Sink scientific process, to underwrite the medium – long term sustainability of the sinks. 4.The formal evaluation and development of new sink opportunities in the southern KZN and Eastern Cape regions.5.Small sclale land owners plant trees on the boundaries of their properties which increases flood protection"

Water stagnates from June-July and remains muddy upto December making it impossible to grow any crop except the low yielding variety. Ramakrishna Mission Lokasiksha Parishad (RKMLSP) undertook a unique project of Land Shaping wherein a part of a field is raised artificially under its rural livelihoods program. The idea of digging ponds to raise the low land with the help of excavated earth provided sufficient rain water for crop irrigation as well as prevented water stagnation. The available land for crop cultivation for marginal farmers was about 0.2 to 0.6 hectare each. One-fifth (20 per cent) of the land selected for LS is dug up to a depth of 2.4 meters. The excavation could be in the center of the plot or on the side – according to the shape and size of the plot. With the excavated earth, a raised bund of 75 cm, along the boundary of the area is made, to stop water from entering the area. This made it suitable for the cultivation of High Yielding variety (HYV) rice, vegetables etc. On the original low land traditional varieties of rice is grown during monsoon season and chillies, sunflower or water melon is grown during winter season using the pond water. Land Shaping (LS) combined with the Integrated Farming Systems Approach is one of the main factors for enhancing productivity in a sustainable way in the Sundarban.The Ramkrishna Mission Loka-Siksha Parishad (RKMLSP), Narendrapur works in 4 blocks in Sundarban where it has so far completed around 1,600 LS projects in small and marginal farmers’ fields in the Sunderbans area in which the low-lying flood-prone land (plots of 1 to 4 bighas) has been raised by excavating a pond, covering 20-25% area of the plot, at an appropriate position for rain water harvesting and using the excavated soil for making bunds and uplands and lifting the said pond water for irrigating the rabi crops."

This is being achieved by encouraging climate-friendly behaviour through lessons and action projects that link with the curriculum. In the process biodiversity conservation and healthy ecosystems are promoted as part of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The framework of the current WESSA/WWF Eco-Schools programme forms the basis through which this is achieved, as it has a well researched and peer reviewed process framework that fosters whole school learning and education for sustainable living. Although there is no requirement to expand on the number of schools in the six climate change nodes, the number of schools has increased in 2010 from 144 to 240 and this is growing in number in all nodes, in almost all cases. Specific measures include:39 lessons on the curicculum relating to climate change, development of a climate change cartoon and theme specific educational puzzle, vegetable gardens and wetland rehabilitation activities.The project is located in the following provinces of South Africa: Western Cape, Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape, Free State and KwaZulu-Natal."

With the completion of a range of climate change risk assessments and an increase in knowledge of future vulnerabilities, local government must consider its own liability and governance in terms of its delegations in approving plans and developments. One of the key drivers for change in the future will be legal accountability and liability for future impacts on private property and commercial developments.  The City is often constrained in taking proactive action through layers of bureaucracy and legislation.  Does the urgency of climate change create a new policy environment that will allow faster more directed action that is not slowed through bureaucratic means? "

There are three components to the project. The first component is the identification and prioritization of adaptation options. The second component is the demonstration and implementation of adaptation measures. The purpose of this component is to introduce, demonstrate and implement the specific adaptation measures in selected demonstration areas, and adjust and integrate appropriate adaptation measures into the implementation of the Third Irrigated Agriculture Intensification Project (IAIL3), in order to reduce vulnerability to climate change in the 3H Basin. Finally, the third component is the mainstreaming adaptation into national CAD program and institutional strengthening. The component will aim at integrating and mainstreaming climate change adaptation into the national CAD program, including a series of capacity building, technical assistance, knowledge sharing, public awareness activities, and preparation of a national climate change adaptation plan for CAD by State Office of Comprehensive Agricultural Development (SOCAD), with the cooperation of Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the National Development and Reform Commission(NDRC) and Ministry of Finance (MOF) national climate change adaptation offices."

At the same time, the project cooperates with government and private-sector players in the maize sector so as to foster production and the seed trade (also for small-scale producers)."

The Mangroves are extremely important to the coastal ecosytstem as they act as soil binders and diffuse impacts of storms. They are a natural habitat for fish, prawns etc and support the fish and shrimp economy and are also habitat for the Royal Bengal Tiger and important for the biodiversity of the region. The WB Forest Department has issued Govt. Orders for formation of Forest Protection Committees (FPC) around the Reserved/ Protected Forests, and Eco-Development Committees (EDC) around the National Park and Sanctuaries of Sundarban region also. Till now, 52 FPCs and 14 EDCs have been registered. They get a 25% share of the entry fee receipts (Rs 10/day per person) from visitors to the SBR. After formation of FPCs/EDCs instances of felling, poaching, have reduced and tiger survival after village visits has increased. The user groups are involved in some of these plantations as well."

The rural, predominantly smallholder population relies mainly on traditional and highly inefficient irrigation technologies and depends greatly upon uncertain rainfall. The Federal Environment Agency (UBA) is coordinating a project of adaptation to climate change in Brazil, which is starting with a workshop in Rio de Janeiro for delegates from affected rural regions. The purpose of the project is to prepare the rural population to cope with increasing aridity. Tried and proven forms of local initiative for adapting to climate change will be disseminated and replicated by building networks. To this end, pilot projects on irrigation in the northeast of Brazil that are already under way will be expanded. In addition, support is being provided to establish a network of municipalities and organizations seeking to disseminate successful adaptation measures. In addition to training measures, a limited amount of technical equipment (such as pumps and irrigation equipment) is also being provided.The participatory approach enables the population in the affected regions to cope better with the impacts of climate change. It is envisaged that the results of the pilot projects will be taken up in regional development plans and other strategy papers and will also contribute to the debate on adaptation measures within the context of negotiations concerning the Framework Convention on Climate Change. Moreover, the project contributes to economic stabilization and to food and income security in the region.”"

The programme has been developed in a phased manner; Phase 1 focused on the assessment of local climate change impacts; Phase 2 focused on the development of an adaptation workstream with three focal areas of action: municipal level, community–level and urban management intervention. The Headline Climate Change Adaptation Strategy (HCCAS), was the fist of the municipal level interventions. This highlighted key interventions required by the municipality to adapt to climate change. Following the HCCAS of phase 2 it was recognised that sector specific adaptation plans needed to be developed in order to start mainstreaming adaptation planning into the municipality. To test this approach three pilot sectors, health, water and disaster management, where chosen, and sector specific adaptation needs identified. Work is also being pursued investigating the impacts of climate change on the city’s globally significant biodiversity and related open space system. Recognising that the resilience of local communities would also need to be increased, a parallel process of community – based adaptation was initiated, focused on livelihood analyses, food and water security issues and community reforestation projects. A third focal area has also been developed which focuses on a variety of urban management interventions, including: sea level rise modelling, a pilot green roof project and a variety of greening initiatives. The next phase of the project, phase 3, involves the development of a tool which will allow for the simulation, evaluation and comparison of strategic development in the city in the context of climate change, and Phase 4 will work towards mainstreaming climate change concerns into city planning and development."

At the same time, adaptation interventions should be implemented in a manner which embeds the current activities and processes in the day to day operations of the municipality. Various sectors within the municipality have different capacities and thus different abilities to integrate climate change adaptation into their activities. A limiting factor for the project is therefore the provision of adequate institutional, human and financial resources necessary for restructuring and for the mainstreaming of climate change adaptations.",

      "no_regret_/_win-win_option": "Focus on and prioritization of climate change adaptation can make the eThekwini Municipality climate smart, and thus more able to deal with climate impacts and projected climate changes. At the same time, the assessment of municipal sector activities and the work towards finding suitable adaptation interventions can also work to highlight shortcomings in municipal structures and activities, and thus trigger necessary improvements in the Municipality. What is more, the strengthening of institutional, human and financial resources necessary to integrate climate change adaptation into municipal structures and activities also work to strengthen the general capacity of the Municipality. Positive side-effects can also be seen more directly in for example the socio-economic and catchment management benefits of the community reforestation projects.",

Jointly, Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region, through the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) of Government of India approached the World Bank to replicate the ‘IFAD model’ in all the 8 NER states. A post project sustainability evaluation has been recommended. An endline evaluation was conducted in May, in 2008 The review after project completion states that the project covered 860 villages against the proposed 1000 villages.The project has formed 1012 NaRM-Gs, 3168 SHGs, 103 Narm-g Cluster Associations and 103 SHG Federations. Socio-economically the number of households having easy access to water increased by 42%, abandonment of jhum by 15% of the households, increase in other cultivation practices such as terrace, orchard and home garden/vegetable cultivation and an increase in NTFP collection (31%), the area under plantation increased by 2716.37 ha.

The crops have been selected based on the knowledge of cultivation and farming, the economic returns, nutritional value and also because these crops are being promoted for the rehabilitation and resettlement of shifting cultivators as they can address the livelihood and food security needs of the people. Organic agriculture systems enhance biological diversity, increase soil biological activity, maintain long term soil fertility and recycle wastes of animal and plant origin thus minimizing the use of non-renewable resources. They also improve soil moisture retention. All these characteristics of organic practices in horticultural crops will give sustained production with minimum inputs thus reducing the need for shifting cultivation for livelihood. Because the organic agricultural systems are more diverse they have greater flexibility to cope with adverse effects of climate change leading to higher economic and ecological stability and also because they have low input costs, the risk of partial or total crop failure will be lowered."

Farmers, local authorities and key stakeholders are educated about agroforestry methods. Seedlings of well adapted tree and shrub species are produced and planted, applying a participatory approach.The transformation into agroforestry systems will reduce soil erosion and soil degradation and improve soil fertility, increase resilience and productivity of local farming systems and enhance their adaptation capacity to impacts of climate change. Furthermore, agroforestry contributes to additional carbon sequestration in tree biomass and soil, increases the availability of energy from renewable sources (firewood) and provides timber for farm income diversification. Finally, the Nyungwe forest with its exceptional biodiversity, its crucial function as carbon sink and its importance for the regional climate (evapotranspiration, small water cycle) can be preserved."

      "feedback": "As a small island, Grenada is particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of projected climate changes. Extreme events such as hurricanes experienced in the recent past are likely to become more intense in the future. Two major droughts occurred in the past years with substantial adverse effects on the water and agriculture sectors. Projections indicate a strong likelihood of declining rainfall in all seasons in the future. Furthermore, Grenada is expected to suffer severe negative impacts as a consequence of sea level rise. 1 metre sea level rise – which can be expected even under strong mitigation globally – may inundate crucial infrastructure and other coastal assets along the coast.  Whilst Grenada has developed many policies and strategies over the years relating to adaptation there remain substantial gaps and challenges in a strategic approach to adaptation, implementation of measures and co-ordination across sectors and scales.  \tThus, the overarching project goal of the Programme is to increase resilience of vulnerable communities and ecosystems to climate change risks in Grenada through integrated adaptation approaches. The project will be implemented jointly by UNDP and GIZ. On the national level, strategic and coordination abilities in adaptation are to be strengthened and a systematic approach to climate risk assessments in various decision making and planning processes is developed (GIZ). At the sector level, support is provided to strengthen water resource management, and to develop a coastal zone management plan for the management of coastal resources in a climate sensitive and efficient manner (GIZ). At the local level, concrete adaptation and climate resilience measures with a strong connection to livelihoods are implemented (UNDP). Finally knowledge management is strengthened (UNDP) and capacity to enable access to international climate finance is built to increase the sustainability of resources for adaptation (GIZ).  This comprehensive and integrated approach can serve as a role model for other countries in the region and as a springboard for further work and funding in Grenada."

Millions of livelihoods in the basin depend on the Mekong as a source of food, means of transport and provider of water for many purposes. Although individual MRC member countries are already implementing adaptation projects, the knowledge and expertise of a regional institution such as MRC will be crucial in managing climate change impacts. There is a clear benefit to plan for and manage potential climate impacts on a regional scale compared to the national of local level. Member Countries of MRC have therefore established the Climate Change and Adaptation Initiative (CCAI). The CCAI serves as a long-term collaborative regional initiative to assist the Member Countries to adapt at the regional, national, and community levels to serious impacts and challenges posed by climate change by building a systematic process of adaptation planning, implementation, and learning. With its emphasis on a basin-wide approach, the CCAI ensures that adaptation to climate change is harmonised with effective adaptation strategies and plans at various levels and is applied at priority locations throughout the basin.The programme’s aim is to support CCAI to improve its services as a knowledge and information hub regarding adaption to climate change in the Mekong region. The cooperation will yield increased expert capacities at MRC to give advice to its Member Countries and to support their planning for targeted and effective adaptation.Advice to specialist and management staff of the MRC and member state authorities on options for adapting to climate change is provided. Initially the Commission is supported in making data, information and reports on climate change available, such as regionalised climate projections for Member States. A regional expert committee (Mekong Panel on Climate Change) will be founded to advise member states. Adaptation options will be developed; progress made in adaptation will be documented using a suitable monitoring system."

INFORMATIONThe project updates and systematizes existing information on the risks and positive effects of climate change for two priority regions and sectors, and prepares vulnerability and risk maps based on these studies. In the two regions and for two priority sectors, methodologies are validated and studies of cost-benefit analysis are carried out.2. GUIDELINES AND CRITERIABased on cost-benefit analysis, the project uses pilot cases to develop at least two instruments of criteria and guidelines that consider climate change and possible adaptation measures in the design of public investment projects in two prioritized sectors. Additionally, design of a budget incentive proposal for funding ofpublic investment for climate change adaptation, incorporating the guidelines and criteria, is underway.3. INSTITUTIONALIZATIONThe project supports planners and evaluators of public investment projects during the process of incorporating the instruments with climate change adaptation in the National Public Investment System. Professionals from national government entities and in two regional governments are trained in the application of the instruments.  In the priority regions, the project tests and validatestools for adaptation of climate change and risk reduction measures in the framework of planning public investment projects. The regions apply the incorporation of climate change adaptive measures on a pilot basis in at least one existing policy instrument. IPACC supports them in the formulation of political guidelines which promote the application of those tools. Also, the project develops a monitoring mechanism for the application of climate change adaptation in public investment.4. KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENTA digital platform provides access to information on risk analysis as required for public investment that is better adapted to climate change. In addition, the project supports the formation of networks in the priority regions. Through knowledge management and the exchange of experiences, relevant stakeholders from other Latin American countries are sensitized and informed about climate change economics."

First the project team built a test wall in an isolated area and embedded it with measuring instruments to measure its performance. The team used a specially designed saw to slice off one side wall in each tire, tied the tires together in a honeycomb pattern using polypropylene rope, and packed them full of compacted earth. The test walls were layered up to six meters high.These retaining walls are an economically viable and environmentally sustainable way of building low-cost structures.

The commune is located at the confluence of two branches of Kon river pouring into Thi Nai Coastal Lagoon. It is a low lying and narrow delta with elevations from sea level in the range of 0.5-1.2 m and therefore has been subject to salt water intrusion and frequent flooding during rainy seasons.The project is designed and implemented by testing demonstration models for solutions to adapt to increasingly severely flooding and salt intrusion. These models should use the research results of selecting and creating high yielding flood tolerant rice varieties (such as varieties named 24SS, SH2, BM207, PC6, H43, H30) carried out by IRRI (International Rice Research Institute) in-cooperation with national agriculture institutes. Local farmers’ experiences in coping with flooding and after-flooding conditions will be fully applied in the models.Furthermore the Project aims to strengthen awareness and local capacity to adapt to climate change. Public awareness raising activities will be conducted widely in the whole commune."

The project aims to combine sustainable water and biodiversity conservation with job creation and skills development amongst members of the local rural communities, in order to promote resilience of ecosystems and communities to climate change. The project will also act as an adaptation mechanism through the restoration of riparian ecosystems which will help buffer the Karoo communities to the predicted impacts of climate change. The re-vegetating and restoring the soils as well as connecting fragmented pieces of vegetation together will increased capability of the ecosystem to provide its services such as water filtration, reducing sedimentation and flood impacts and build resilience to the impacts of climate change.Specific Measures:1.Develop and implement a strategy to regenerate degraded riparian zones on farms to create corridors of suitable habitat for Riverine Rabbit dispersal.2.The ongoing development and propagation of seedlings of indigenous riparian plants in the Karoo Indigenous Plant Nursery in Loxton.3.Training of nursery staff (i.e Seed collection, seed germination, seedling care, infrastructure management, trail maintenance, simple construction, etc.)4.The formal mapping and recording of the planting and restoration process into a database, thereby allowing for the restoration process to be formally tracked and quantified over time. This includes monitoring for climate change adaptation.5.Provide opportunities for members of the rural Loxton community to engage in conservation through skills training and providing employment opportunities, particularly for women and the previously disadvantaged.6.Develop guidelines for landowners to rehabilitate degraded riparian corridors to promote long term sustainability of natural resources (e.g  soil conservation techniques such as digging hollows, mashing)"

An innovative, demand-based approach was developed to address the water supply crisis  in Sedgefield, and this proved to be cost effective and achievable in the time scales required.  The approach included the construction of the Sedgefield desalination plant, a single-pass, reverse osmosis (RO) system that can produce potable water of 1. 5M?/day. Initially the plant will be operated by the supplier for one year – which will probably be extended to three or five years. The team is justifiably proud to have commissioned the plant within three months:  the contract award was signed on 1 October 2009 and the plant was functional on 18 December 2009, in time for the anticipated holiday peak in December 2009."

With a view to increase peoples participation in forest protection and management the Rajasthan Forest Department collaborated with the Barodiya Panchayat in Jaipur district, to plant a total of 73 acres in the years 1985, 1992 and 1993 with species like Acacia tortilis, Eucalyptus spp. and Dalbargia sissoo. The plantation provided the communities with fuel wood, fodder and timber benefits. A management plan was prepared to harvest the plantation after completion of its rotation period. Based on the harvest plan, an auction was held which led to high bids and the revenue was divided equally between the community and the forest department, as per the state government order S. F. (17) 11 Raj./8/82-A/ on June 5, 1982 regulations."

Drought and flood management is improved by infrastructural measures as well as capacity development.2. Resilience of agriculture is increased by flood protection, introduction of more tolerant crop varieties, water use efficiency, and index-based insurance.3. Infrastructure is made more climate proof through Green planning and improved design standards for roads, improved sanitation infrastructure, and mainstreaming of adaptation concerns into urban planning. Community-based efforts protect infrastructure from weather extremes."

This includes collection of topographic data and development of digital elevation models, analysis, and training.2. The regional climate monitoring network is consolidated in order to improve disaster management and data sharing.3. Development of regional climate models for useful precise climate projections.4. Vulnerability reduction in the food security, economic livelihoods, and human health areas.The project is designed in a staged approach, with concrete adaptation measures being taken as climate impacts can be better estimated.

Building capacity for climate resilience through strengthening institutions, awareness raising and women's empowerment2. Improvement of Weather, Climate and Hydrological Service Delivery aimed at improving the national hydro-meteorological monitoring system to provide timely warnings on dangerous events, support water management, and build the evidentiary basis for climate variability and change.3. Climate Science and Modelling Programme aimed at enhancing Tajikistan‘s capacity to conduct climate and glacier research and develop appropriate models 4. Enhancing the Climate Resilience of the Energy sector through improving the hydro power infrastructure5. Agriculture and Sustainable Land management aimed at replicating and scaling up effective, existing land management practices to ensure that climate resilience becomes an integral part of land management and agricultural production6.

In 1977 under the guidance of  PR Mishra four tanks were built to conserve rainwater. This increased water storage and provided protective irrigation to the rainfed crops, increasing yields. This became an incentive to the villagers to stop grazing and initiate afforestation and watershed protection in the catchment, to reduce erosion and prevent sedimentation of their tanks. As many of the graziers did not own land and thus would not benefit directly from the water and increased yields, an innovative step was taken – of spliting water ownership from land ownership. The water stored was made the property of all villagers – equally shared by both land holders and landless, thus the landed bought water beyond their share from the landless folks. The project gave increased yields in agriculture, protected forest cover, and reduced erosion. The dam and catchment management was undertaken by Hill Resource Management Societies (HRMS) and HRMS were set up in scores of villages in the region."

Intact coastal forests attenuate the wind and waves and safeguard the embankments needed to protect the low-lying, extensive Mekong delta against inundation.The project advises and supports the provincial Agencies in the development of protective mechanisms for the coastal zone, the management and rehabilitation of the mangrove forests, and the development of implementation mechanisms. In order to improve coastal protection, coastal forests in Bac Lieu Province are being afforested and restored. Conservation zones for mangrove forests administered jointly by the local population and the provincial government are being established. At the same time, the economic situation of coastal populations is being improved. The people thus become less dependent upon the coastal forests and can use these more sustainably. In addition, local government staffs are being trained and relevant institutions are being strengthened."

Seeing the initial success farmers started adopting this technique with the help of project team.  In 25 blocks in 4 districts the land cultivated under conventional method is around 1,633,329.67 acre. More than 189,594 households of 1505 villages grow paddy through conventional technique.  In these 25 blocks, the SRI is practiced by 10181 households spread over 641 villages and 8924 acrea of area.  An input output analysis of the conventional method of rice cultivation and SRI, the yield increase from an average of 15 to 36 quintals per ha or 140%. The gross return (@ Rs 800/quintal of paddy)  is Rs 12000 under conventional practise and Rs 28800 after SRI and the cost of cultivation is Rs 2695 under conventionel method and Rs 3065 under SRI method, so the net returns are Rs 9305 and Rs 25735 respectively – an increase of over 170%<br>"

The technique involves digging a checkerboard network of shallow recessed squares a few metres in length and under 1ft deep with an overall bund on the three lower sides in a U-shape  along moderate sloped plains.  A 2 km by 1.5 km area of pastureland would have choukas dug around the edge of the area with two foot high bunds creating a barrier surrounding the field. Each Choukha fills with water and excess flows to the next interconnected chaukha and so on. This system retains soil moisture beyond the monsoon to rejuvenate dry pasture lands and capture and divert rain water for ground water recharge and future use into low lying water tanks and ponds. The system is suitable for arid and semi-arid areas.  The choukas have enabled the conversion of dry wastelands to fodder rich areas and has also helped increase the diversity of medicinal herbs and avian fauna."

This represents a substantial increase since the annual income for many farming families in this region is as low as Rs 7,000. Many farmers have doubled their income, and a few have seen it rise ten-fold. Farmers can easily pay back the Rs 1,200 to 1,300 cost of the pump from their increased earnings.Use of treadle pump allows farmers to cultivate all the year round thus increasing their cropping intensity to 200-300%,and never leave their land fallow.The income impact of the Treadle Pump technology varies across households and regions, but US$100 per year is the conservative estimate of the average increase in the annual net income of each household. Since inception in 1991, around 750,000 treadle pumps have been adopted by small holder farm families."

The adaptation approach comprises a process of identifying and projecting climate risks, climate trend analysis, current and projected hazard analysis, dynamic vulnerability assessment, and baseline and future risk analysis. Identification of adaptation options is based on results of the climate risk assessment under consideration of specific features of the target area. Main outputs are risk maps as support tools for decision-makers as well as a list of adaptation options agreed upon by involved stakeholders and mainstreamed into the development policies. "

It operates on the principle of area approach – the geographical area around a reference weather station is pre-notified by the State Level Coordination Committee on Crop Insurance (SLCCCI). The scheme is valid for crops that have been notified by SLCCCI. The sum insured is almost the same as the cost of cultivation and predeclared by AIC (Agriculture Insurance Company of India Limited) and even the crops to be insured are notified two months before a season. It currently insures crops in the Rabi (winter) and Kharif (monsoon) seasons and only those crops that have been notified by the State Government are considered for insurance.  Coverage is available for deficit rainfall (both volume and distribution ) and excess rainfall, with triggers defined for each."

    "additional_information": "For a crop in the Kharif season there are two types of insurance covers (i) Deficit rainfall cover- (a) Rainfall cover Volume: This is divided into three phases, periods of which depend upon the crops being grown. In each phase there are two triggers based on amount of rainfall and for both these triggers there is a different rate (Rs./mm). The maximum payout for these phases is different for each crop but the total maximum payout under the cover is Rs. 3000 for each crop. (b) Rainfall Distribution Cover (Consecutive dry days): for this there is one trigger based on the number of dry days and the payout (maximum and for number of trigger days) varies accordingly with each crop and number of consecutive dry days. (ii) Excess Rainfall Cover (multiple crops): In this case there can be one or two phases with time periods, amount of rainfall and payout varying for different crops and for those that have different phases. The premium for each is 10% of the total sum insured. The scheme for weather based insurance is also applicable for the Rabi crops and has been initiated since the year 2007-08.

Therefore, it is recommended to compress the area of maize and generally expand the rice cultivation area.2, With the increase of heat resources in the river basin, change cropping/harvesting system once per year into twice or even thrice per year to raise the food production.3, Planting the rice with longer growth period would increase the yield of about 17-23% compared to that of original crop varieties in the river basin."
